In a general context, the Five of Pentacles is not a great card to get as it represents hardship, rejection or a negative change in circumstances. You may be feeling like the world is against you and nothing is going your way when it appears. It can signify bad luck, struggles or adversity. Homelessness, unemployment, alienation and poverty are all represented by this Minor Arcana card and it can signify illness, divorce, breakups or scandals causing turmoil in your life. If you are feeling left out the cold, firstly, remember that this situation is only temporary and then ask yourself if you are reaching out for any help or support that is available. There is help out there for you. It may be in the form of moral support from friends or family, financial assistance from social welfare, or even the kindness of strangers but whatever it is, take it. Nothing lasts forever and this hardship too shall pass.
