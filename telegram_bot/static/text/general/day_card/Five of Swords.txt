In a general context, the Five of Swords is not always a good omen as it can represent defeat, change surrender and walking away. It is a Minor Arcana card of self-sabotaging or underhanded behaviour and deception and lack of communication. It can also represent serious conflict, stress and lack of communication. The Five of Swords Tarot card comes with a warning as it can signify hostility, aggression, intimidation and violence and as such it can represent situations we would hope to never encounter in our lives such as crime, theft, bullying, abuse, assault, rape, murder. On the other hand, it may simply represent the action one must take to overcome being challenged by others such as standing up for oneself and fighting back. As such it can be an indication of victory. If so, the victory it represents will be hard won as you will have quite a battle on your hands.
