In a general context, the Nine of Wands tells you that you are half way through a battle. Recent events have left you drained of all energy and feeling like you canâ€™t go on, but you are so close to getting what you want! You just need to gather the last of your strength and push forward and you will be successful. It represents ongoing battles, being battle weary, drained of energy and fatigued. It also signifies courage, persistence, strength of will, having a backbone, holding out and perseverance. It is a Minor Arcana card of gathering your strength, learning from past failures, fighting your corner and making your last stand. You may be wounded, guarded or expecting trouble when it appears in your Tarot reading. It can suggest that things have not worked out the way you planned and there have been challenges and setbacks along the way. The Nine of Wands also tells you that you are close to success or nearly there.
