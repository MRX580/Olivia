The Justice Tarot card relates to karmic justice, legal matters and cause and effect. In a general context Justice is showing you that all actions have consequences. So look at your present circumstances in that context, how have your own actions contributed to where you find yourself today? Are there any karmic lessons that you should be learning from your current situation? This Major Arcana card is also a signifier of legal matters being resolved in a fair and balanced matter. This is usually a favourable omen if you are involved in a legal dispute. Justice is concerned with truth and integrity, so you may find yourself compelled to speak the truth and that you more than ever value honesty and integrity in others. Justice also relates to balance. It may signify that circumstances may arise that could throw you off balance. These circumstances may or may not be beyond your control or of your own making. Either way, you must try to keep yourself on an even-keel as events unfold. The Justice card can also indicate that you have a choice to make when it appears in your Tarot readings as you will be weighing up all your options and balancing the scales.
