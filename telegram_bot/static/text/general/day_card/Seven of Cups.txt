In a general context, the Seven of Cups Tarot card represents having lots of options to choose from or multiple possibilities open to you. It can be an indication that you have so many choices or so many things going on at once that you may be overwhelmed or unable to focus properly. You need to limit the amount of things you are taking on to a manageable amount. There is no point in agreeing to do things if you canâ€™t give them the time and attention they deserve. Try to be realistic about what you can commit to. The Seven of Cups can also signify that you may be indulging in wishful thinking, fantasies or living in a dream world. When this Minor Arcana card appears in a Tarot reading, it indicates that you need to make a decision in your life and realistically look at where you are. Take proactive steps to make your situation better rather than fantasising about how you want it to be. Your imagination is a great tool to help you envision your future but it will never happen unless you take action to make it happen.
