He is a powerful, grounded protector but he also can be rigid and stubborn. This can be a father or father-figure type or an older man you are romantically involved with. The Emperor is a hard task master and has little time for fun and frivolity. Children of The Emperor can struggle with father issues as falling short of his high expectations can affect their self-esteem.
