In a general context, the Ten of Swords is not a good omen as it can represent backstabbing betrayal, badmouthing, bitching behind your back, bitterness and enemies. It is a Minor Arcana card of failure, ruin, collapse, severing ties, goodbyes and the final nail in the coffin of a relationship or situation. It can signify nervous breakdowns, chronic fatigue, exhaustion and being unable to cope. It can also represent hitting rock bottom, hitting a wall or being in a dead end situation. The Ten of Swords can also indicate someone playing the victim or martyr, being overly dramatic, attention seeking or exaggerating. It can also signify violence, attacks and curses.
