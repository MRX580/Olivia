In a general context, the Three of Swords represents unhappiness, heartache, sorrow and sadness. It is a Minor Arcana card of grief, loss, depression and tears and when it appears in your Tarot reading it generally indicates a period of difficulty or hardship, usually on an emotional level. Distraction, conflict, disillusion and serious misunderstanding are all represented by this card so whatever situation it signifies will bring with it confusion, upset and upheaval. The Three of Swords also indicates depression, trauma, disorders, loneliness, absence and betrayal. You have suffered or will suffer a loss or betrayal of some kind when this card appears and not one that can easily be brushed over. You will be feeling this loss on a deep emotional level and you must give yourself time to process what has happened. Though it does represent hardship, this card is not all bad. The most difficult situations in our lives often teach us more about who we are and what we are capable of than the good times. Give yourself space and time to heal and learn all you can from the experience. If you need support, donâ€™t be afraid to reach out to the people that love you.
