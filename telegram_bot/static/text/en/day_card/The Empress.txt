The Empress Tarot is the Major Arcana card of femininity and motherhood. It is also one of the strongest pregnancy cards in the Tarot deck. If you are a mother, you will really come into your own and find fulfilment. If you are a father, The Empress encourages you to build on your communication with your children and show them your nurturing side. Even if you are not a parent, when The Empress appears the message is the same, you should embrace your softer side, allow yourself to explore the emotions you are feeling and listen to your intuition. People will be drawn to you, especially those in need of the empathy, compassion and nurturing you are able to provide.
