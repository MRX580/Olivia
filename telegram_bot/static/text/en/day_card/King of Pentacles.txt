In a general Tarot spread, the King of Pentacles represents trying to better oneself, hard work paying off, reaching goals, seeing things through to the end and being proud of your achievements. This Minor Arcana card can represent reaching high social status and being enterprising, resourceful and principled. As a person, the King of Pentacles represents a mature successful grounded man who is good in business, patient, stable, secure, loyal and a hard worker. He is a generous provider but is not careless or frivolous with his wealth and he doesn’t gamble or take silly risks. He is conservative and can be stubborn but he is also faithful and a protector. He is a great father in terms of providing stability and security but can come across as a bit blunt when dealing with emotional matters as he copes better with practical matters. He may be an Earth sign such as Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.
