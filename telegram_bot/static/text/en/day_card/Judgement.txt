In a general context, the Judgement Tarot card can indicate that you and/or someone you care about are being judged too harshly by others. It can also indicate that you are judging people harshly or making snap judgements yourself. Alternatively, Judgement can also be an indication that you have achieved a level of clarity and composure that allows you to calmly evaluate yourself and your choices in order to make positive decisions. You have come through your past karmic lessons with increased self-awareness and you are allowing healing to take place so you can move forward in a positive direction. If you have a big decision to make when this Major Arcana card appears, use the karmic lessons you have learnt from the past to help you make the right choice.  Judgement upright can represent a legal matter or court case being resolved. If you have acted honourably and told the truth, this matter should be resolved in your favour. If you have been dishonest, don’t expect things to go your way. You need to clear your conscience and try to make amends for your misdeeds. This Major Arcana card can also signify being separated from someone you love by an ocean or sea. You can expect to be reunited with them soon when it appears. It can also indicate homesickness.
