The general meaning of The Moon Tarot card in an upright position is that everything is not as it seems. It is also the Major Arcana Tarot card of intuition. The Moons tells you that something about a situation or person in your life is not what it appears to be and you need to trust what your instincts are telling you in order to see past this illusion. The Moon also indicates that you should pay attention to your dreams as your subconscious may be bringing your attention to some information you’ve missed. The Moon can also signify that you are letting your anxiety or fear overwhelm you which may be having a negative effect on your outlook and causing you to suffer from mood swings, instability or insecurity. It can also represent a woman’s menstrual cycle. The Moon can also signify dormant insecurities or repressed issues resurfacing. The Moon Tarot card can represent underhanded or dodgy deals or illegal behaviour. If it appears in this context it is a warning to clean your act up before your behaviour is exposed. If you are awaiting a decision on something, The Moon indicates that the answer will either be delayed or be so vague it will add to your confusion rather than clarify matters
