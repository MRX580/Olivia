If you are in a relationship, The Devil Tarot card reversed can indicate that you and your partner may have been feeling stuck in a rut or felt like the relationship was on its way out but you having started to come out the other side of this. It can also be an indicator of a close call, one of you may have come close to doing something that would have irreparably damaged your relationship (e.g. an affair or infidelity) but decided to honour your relationship instead. If you have been in an abusive relationship, you may be beginning to realise that you deserve better and to take back your power. The influence your abusive partner once had over you may be lessening as you start to realise that you have choices and there is help out there for you. If you are single, The Devil reversed can indicate a close call with the type of negative, abusive or dangerous person described in the upright meaning. It can also indicate that previously you may have felt you were stuck with being single or were so desperately seeking someone to love you that you were prepared to put up anything. However, you are starting to become more aware of yourself and how this behaviour has been hindering your search for love. You may need to take a step back from dating for while to just start enjoying the freedom of only having yourself to answer to that being single brings. With this new attitude emerging, the right partner wonâ€™t be far behind so relax and enjoy this time.
