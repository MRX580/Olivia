In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Ten of Wands reversed can indicate that you are offloading some of your stresses and responsibilities thus leaving room for the fun and spontaneity to come back. Your partner may be taking on more duties and sharing burdens making you closer and more connected. It can also indicate one or both of you completely shirking your responsibilities.Â  Alternately, it can indicate that you are so overloaded with duties and stresses that the relationship is on the brink if collapse. This reversed Minor Arcana card can be a bad omen as it can indicate that you are flogging a dead horse by pushing forward in your relationship and putting lots of work in but getting nowhere. If you are single, the Ten of Wands reversed suggests that you may be offloading your burdens and stress which will give you time for dating or meeting someone new and allow more fun, spontaneity and excitement into your life.
