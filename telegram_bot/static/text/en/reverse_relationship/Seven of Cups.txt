In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Seven of Cups reversed indicates that you are starting to get a reality check about where your relationship is after a period of avoiding reality. You need to use this clarity to take stock of the relationship and take action to fix any issues that need to be resolved. Ignoring issues will not make them go away. If you are single, the Seven of Cups reversed indicates that you may be limiting the possibilities for romance by sticking too rigidly to an unrealistic or idealised notion of your perfect partner. Try to loosen up and date people you might not normally date.
