In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Two of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you are trying to juggle too much and not finding time for the relationship. Work, financial stress, family issues etc. may be taking your attention away from your partner. This stress may be causing arguments and resentment and could be pushing your relationship to breaking point. It can also signify an affair as in having to choose between two relationships. If you are single, the Two of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you are so overwhelmed by the demands on you that you are not in a position to commit the time needed for a new relationship to flourish. If you want to find a partner you need to make love a priority in your life.
