In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Nine of Swords reversed can indicate that if there has been infidelity or deception in the relationship it will now come to light. If you have cheated on your partner you may have come clean or been caught out as this card can indicate a scandal and extreme remorse, regret, guilt or shame. If you have had suspicions about your partner, unfortunately, the appearance of this card can signify that your fears will be confirmed. However, there is a release associated with this reversed Minor Arcana card as it shows the issues being brought to a head so you can face them and move on.  Again, if not relating to deception, this card may relate to you or your partner having mental health/ anxiety issues. They will either improve, bringing light into the relationship, or spiral, causing more upheaval in your relationship. The supporting cards should give you an indication of which applies. If you are single, the Nine of Swords reversed can indicate that you are starting to see the light at the end of tunnel after a period of despair. You are finally starting to let go of feelings of remorse, guilt or regret relating to past relationships that were haunting you and causing you deep unhappiness. You are getting ready to go back out and re-join the world. Alternatively, this card can indicate a worsening of those feelings and sinking deeper, what are you beating yourself up for? You can’t change the past. You can only learn from it and move forward the best way you know how. So give yourself a break! This card can also indicate that you may find yourself in the middle of scandal, so make sure you are acting with integrity and that potential suitors are not already spoken for!
