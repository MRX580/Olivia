In a love Tarot reading, if you are single, The Empress reversed can indicate that you will have many potential partners pursuing you but you may not necessarily be putting out to the world the person you really are. Don’t try to be someone you’re not, just to gain other people’s approval especially when it comes to romantic relationships.  If you are in a relationship it can indicate that you are not expressing your true emotions and suppressing them to try and keep your relationship in balance. Maybe you fear rejection or a negative reaction if you are honest with your partner about how you feel. You need to take time to figure out why you are suppressing your emotions. Be mindful of becoming overbearing to those around you as you may have this tendency at the moment. It is simply a symptom of the insecurities you are feeling inside, so shift the focus back to yourself and it will stop. Trust your intuition and let it guide you back to the beautiful, confident and inspiring person you were born to be!
