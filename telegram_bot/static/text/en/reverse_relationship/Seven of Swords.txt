In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Seven of Swords reversed is not a great omen as although the card has reversed it usually still indicates that there has been deception or cheating in the relationship. This deception will be exposed and truth will come out but this card can indicate a number of scenarios in the circumstances that bring this about. The cheater or deceiver may trip themselves up or accidentally expose their lies but their partner may ignore the warning signs or choose to turn a blind eye to their behaviour. The cheater/deceiver may discover their conscience, come clean, confess and turn over a new leaf and their partner may choose to forgive them and move on. The cheater may be get caught out and run away with the person they have been cheating with. However, again, you must not jump to conclusions when this Minor Arcana card appears reversed as it can also be an indication that a third party who has been spreading lies or stirring trouble in your relationship will be exposed for the liar they are. If you are single, the Seven of Swords reversed indicates that you may meet someone who is a pathological liar or a serial cheater so beware! It can also be an indication that you are ready to give up the game playing of your previous relationship and are ready to turn over a new leaf and be more genuine with potential partners.
