In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Page of Cups reversed can indicate disappointment in love, cancelled engagements, heartbreak or breakups. It can also be an indicator that you may have become overly sensitive or high maintenance or that childishness or drama queen type behaviour may be causing friction in your relationship. If that is the case, you need to evaluate your priorities and take a more mature approach to your relationship if you want it to work. It can also simply be an indication of losing your virginity and becoming sexually active. The Page of Cups reversed is not great if you are single, as it can represent unrequited love. If this is the case, be careful not to fall in a pattern of childish revenge plots, envy, jealousy or vindictiveness. It can also be an indication that you may be engaging in promiscuous behaviour which is not bringing you the love you want. It’s all well and good to enjoy a bit of flirting but be mindful of what type of relationship you want and stay true to yourself. You could possibly be seduced by a heartbreaker if you’re not careful!
