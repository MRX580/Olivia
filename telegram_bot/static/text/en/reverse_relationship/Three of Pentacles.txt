In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Three of Pentacles reversed can indicate that a third party may be causing friction in your relationship. It can also indicate a lack of commitment or growth. It can signify that you and your partner are not putting the effort in to make the relationship work and that there is a feeling of apathy towards each other. If you are single, the Three of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you are not putting your best foot forward in terms of relationships. You may be feeling apathy towards the idea of dating or are just not prepared to put the effort into meeting someone. It can also be a sign that you are not learning from your past mistakes and as such are repeating relationship/dating patterns that have not worked for you in the past.
