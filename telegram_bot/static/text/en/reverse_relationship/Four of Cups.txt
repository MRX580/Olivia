In a love Tarot reading, if you are single, the Four of Cups Tarot card reversed can indicate that you are coming out a period of detachment or solitude where you were not interested in dating or starting a relationship. You may have withdrawn from the world due to the trauma of a bad breakup to give yourself time to heal. The Four of Cups reversed indicates that you are done wallowing in your heartbreak and are ready for a fresh start. If you are in a relationship, the Four of Cups reversed indicates that after a long period of soul-searching, you may have realised that the relationship no longer works and you may be ready to let it go. Alternatively, you may be ready to focus on the relationship and suddenly find you have newfound enthusiasm and interest in making the relationship work.
