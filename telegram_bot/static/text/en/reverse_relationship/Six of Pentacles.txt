In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Six of Pentacles reversed is not a good card to get as it indicates that your relationship lacks balance and that one of you may be dominating the other or abusing your power over them or that one of you has become too dependent or subservient to the other. It can also indicate that one of you may be abusing the other person’s good nature, taking too much and not giving anything back. This lack of balance in the relationship could lead to serious problems if left uncorrected. If you are single, the Six of Pentacles reversed can indicate that greed or meanness may be putting off potential partners. You may be putting up barriers by not having an open and kind approach to the new potential partners you meet. Alternately, you may be too generous for your own good and letting new people use you or take advantage of your kindness. Try to find the balance, be open to the possibility of meeting and trusting someone new but keep your eyes open and don’t allow yourself to be played!
