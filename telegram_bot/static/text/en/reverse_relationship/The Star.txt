If you are in a relationship, The Star reversed indicates that you may have lost faith in the relationship or are focusing on the negative and missing the positive aspects of your relationship. Your relationship may have lost some of its spark, you may feel that the relationship has become stagnant and monotonous and that you and your partner have disconnected on some level. The Star reversed tells you that these problems can be fixed but you have to be prepared to heal old wounds and clear out any negative energy from the relationship if you want to go forward. If you are single, The Star reversed indicates loneliness and lack of faith in the universe’s plan for you. You may be feeling like you will never meet the right person for you. You may feel that you are becoming cynical about love. You need to release your fears and let go of the negative energy you’ve been holding on to in order to move forward. Love will appear when you least expect it!
