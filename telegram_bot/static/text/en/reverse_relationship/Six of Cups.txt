In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Six of Cups reversed can represent boredom or a lack of passion in the relationship. Although the relationship gives you security, you may be finding it stifling. If you are single, the Six of Cups reversed can indicate that you are ready to put your past relationships behind you and move onto something better. Alternately, it can indicate that you are still looking at your past relationship through rose tinted glasses and comparing anyone new you meet unfavourably to your ex. In order to move forward, you need to remember that your past relationship is over for a reason. Holding onto the past will not change anything and you could end up wishing your life away. Give someone new a chance! The Six of Cups can also signify that childhood issues or childhood abuse may be preventing you from finding the love you deserve or affecting your ability to open up to your partner if you are in relationship.
