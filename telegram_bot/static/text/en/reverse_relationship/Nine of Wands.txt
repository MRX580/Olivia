In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Nine of Wands reversed can indicate that you and your partner may have been arguing previously and have now gotten locked in a stalemate where you are both digging your heals in and refusing to compromise. Alternatively, this Minor Arcana card can suggest that you have no fight left and want to withdraw from the relationship altogether. If the relationship is to last, there needs to be some compromise and you both need to learn from past mistakes. If you find yourself in an obstinate or stubborn mood just ask yourself, do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? If you are in a new relationship, the Nine of Wands reversed can indicate that your new partner may have a bit of a chip on their shoulder about how much they have been hurt in the past. You can be compassionate but remember you are not to blame for their past relationship failures so don’t tolerate them taking it out on you. If you are single, the Nine of Wands reversed indicates that you may be starting to feel ready to drop your guard when it comes to love. This is a great development! You have learned from your past relationships, grieved, gotten your strength back and are ready to move on. Alternatively, it can indicate that past relationship trauma has left you so wounded that you have completely given up on love. You need to give yourself space to get your strength back but don’t close yourself off to the possibility of meeting someone new. Not everyone out there will hurt you.
