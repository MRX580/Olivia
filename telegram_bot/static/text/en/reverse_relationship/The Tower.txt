In a love context, if you are in a relationship, The Tower reversed can signify that while you know your relationship is as good as over, you are avoiding actually ending it for fear of the pain it will bring. You may think you can paper over the cracks but this would be like putting a band aid on a gunshot wound. You need to face facts and understand that as long as you hold onto something that is broken you are preventing yourself from moving onto something better. If your relationship has recently come through a Tower event, different but intact, The Tower reversed is telling you not to try and get the relationship back to the way it was previously. Your relationship has changed because it needed to, you can’t go back. You need to decide if this new version of your relationship is something you want. If you are single, The Tower reversed can indicate that you have avoided a disastrous relationship with someone who was possibly dangerous, abusive or violent. It can also indicate that you are delaying or completely avoiding dealing with a traumatic or painful breakup. While you may think this approach is easier than facing up to what you’ve been through, it is actually stopping you from moving on your love life.  Stop and face whatever you’re running from, learn what you can from it and then draw a line under it and leave it in the past where it belongs. It hard to move forward when you’re dragging a truck load of baggage behind you so deal with it and let it go.
