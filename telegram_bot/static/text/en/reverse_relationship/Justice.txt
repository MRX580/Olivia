In a love context, if you are in a relationship Justice reversed can be a strong indicator of being caught out in a deception or cheating. So if you have been cheating on your partner or lying to them, expect big repercussions. You may also find that any arguments between you and your partner seem endless with this Major Arcana trump card in your Tarot reading. It can also be a sign that you feel you are not being treated fairly or as an equal in the relationship. Before you go casting judgements on your partner, examine your own role in the relationship and ask yourself if you are being fair by apportioning the blame to your partner. If you assess your relationship issues and feel you are blameless, you should still try to learn from the situation. Remember, we teach people how to treat us and what we put up with, we end up with! If you are single, Justice reversed can indicate that while you may feel you are ready for the relationship you deserve, you have still not learned the lessons from your past relationships that are necessary for you to move forward and avoid repeating the same mistakes. It can also indicate that you tend to lack balance in relationships and this maybe causing your relationships to flounder. We all get caught up in the initial excitement of new love but be careful not lose yourself completely! Try to maintain a balance between you love life and your own independent life when you meet someone, it will give your relationships the space they need to grow. If you have treated past partners badly, Justice reversed can be a sign that you may be suffering the consequences of your actions.
