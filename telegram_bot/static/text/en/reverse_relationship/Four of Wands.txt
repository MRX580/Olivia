In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Four of Wands reversed is not a great omen as it can represent unhappy family life, failure, instability, insecurity, neglect and being uprooted so your relationship may be going through a tough or an unpredictable time when it appears in your Tarot spread. When reversed, it is also a Minor Arcana card signifying cancelled or postponed celebrations and family being divided so it can indicate that you and your partner may not be seeing eye-to-eye or you may be having some issues with getting your family to accept your relationship. It is an indicator being jilted at the altar or a postponed wedding so if you are hoping to tie the knot it is not a very welcome card to see. If you are single, the Four of Wands reversed is not a good omen as it can represent self-doubt and feeling like you donâ€™t fit in. It also indicates cancelled celebrations so you may not be having a great social life when it appears. If you have been hoping for a reunion with a past love, this card would see the reunion cancelled or postponed.
