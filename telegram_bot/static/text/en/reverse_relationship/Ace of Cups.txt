If you are single, the Ace of Cups in a reversed position can signify that you may be finding it difficult to find or maintain a relationship at this time. This may be due to repressing emotions or being unwilling or unable to approach new relationships with an open heart as you are still holding on to your feelings for an unrequited love. The Ace of Cups reversed can also indicate that you have unrealistic expectations of your potential partners which are leading to disappointment. If you are in a relationship, the Ace of Cups reversed can indicate that you are not fully opening your heart. Perhaps you have been hurt in the past and are struggling to allow yourself to be vulnerable. This will ultimately hold your relationship back if you do not resolve these issues. The Ace of Cups reversed can also indicate a breakup or divorce.
