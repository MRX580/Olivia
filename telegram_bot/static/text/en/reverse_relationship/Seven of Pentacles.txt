In a love Tarot spread, if you are in relationship, the Seven of Pentacles Tarot reversed is generally not a great card to get as it can represent a relationship hitting a rough patch. It can signify getting bogged down in drudgery or a lack of growth within the relationship.  You may both need a bit of “me” time or a break from the norm as well as time together when it appears. It can also be an indicator that one or both of you is not putting enough effort in. You may be too focused on work, finances or other factors at the moment and not making enough time for each other, which can lead to a loss of connection. It can also mean that you may be frustrated that the relationship is not progressing a quickly as you want it to and feel like your efforts are going to waste.  Whatever the issue, you need to stop and take stock of what’s important in your life and refocus your efforts on bringing that to you. You may need to completely rethink the plans you made together and decide if that’s still where you want to be headed. If you are single, the Seven of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you may be overly focused on career or material wealth and not making time for love to come into your life. Or you may be frustrated that your love life is not progressing in the way you would like. Look at where you are focusing your efforts.  The man or woman of your dreams is probably not just going to knock on your door so you have to make the effort to get out there and meet people. At the same time, trying too hard can come off as needy or desperate. Make an effort but don’t be overly controlling or pushy, love needs to be nurtured but also given the room to breathe and grow.
