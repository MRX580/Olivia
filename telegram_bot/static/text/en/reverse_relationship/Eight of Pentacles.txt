In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Eight of Pentacles reversed indicates that you are not putting the effort in when it comes to your relationship and there may be a lack of commitment or just laziness in terms of making your relationship work. It can also signify letting workaholic tendencies have an adverse effect on your relationship.  When this Minor Arcana card appears, boredom and complacency may be setting in. When it comes to relationships you’ll only get back what you put in, so make the effort to make your partner feel appreciated if you want to resolve the issues you’re facing. If you are single, the Eight of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you may be lacking in confidence when it comes to meeting new people. It can also indicate that you are not putting the effort into meeting new people, which may be leaving you feeling bored and listless. Again, it can also be an indication that you are putting too much focus on work and neglecting your romantic side. If you want to meet someone special, you need to put some time and effort in the romantic side of life and get yourself out there.
