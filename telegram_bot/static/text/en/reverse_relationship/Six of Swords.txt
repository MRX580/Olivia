In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Six of Swords reversed indicates that your relationship is stormy at the moment and you are going through a rough patch or a troubled period. You may be feeling overwhelmed, trapped or stuck or the relationship may not be progressing as quickly as you would like. It can also indicate that a third party may be causing trouble in your relationship. If you are getting married, this Minor Arcana card reversed can indicate that you will elope. If you are single, the Six of Swords reversed can indicate a period of disruption in your love life or simply a time where there is nothing much happening or a lack of progress. The wounds of your previous relationship are slow to heal at the moment and you may be feeling overwhelmed. When this Minor Arcana card appears reversed in your Tarot spread it warns you that you need to allow yourself time to heal, even if healing takes longer than you would like. If you jump into a new relationship before you have processed the effects of the last one, you may find that you have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire.
