If you are in a relationship, Judgement reversed can indicate that you are avoiding making a decision about the relationship because of self-doubt. Whether this decision is about the relationship moving forward or ending, it is a decision that needs to be made. Judgement reversed can also indicate malicious gossip or false accusations so if you have heard nasty rumours about your partner, make sure you get the facts before you rush to judgement. The Judgement Tarot card reversed can also indicate issues caused by failure to learn from the past. Perhaps you and your partner have been through a rough patch and you feel like you should be closer now but you’re not. Ask yourself have you learned all you could from those past issues and are you applying that knowledge to your relationship? If you are single, Judgement reversed can indicate that you are letting shyness or embarrassment stop you from approaching the person you are interested in. Don’t let fear hold you back! Whether or not it works out the way you want it to, at least you’ll know you tried and you won’t have to forever wonder “what if?”
