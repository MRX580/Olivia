If you are in a relationship, the Death Tarot card reversed in a love tarot reading, is a strong indicator that you are resistant to a change in your relationship. You may be holding on to a relationship that has long since run its course because you feel dependent on your partner or are terrified of loneliness. Or you may be staying with a partner who you no longer love out of a sense of obligation. It can also indicate that a relationship that you thought was finished long ago could resurface and rekindle. If you are single, Death reversed is a strong indicator that you need to let go of negative behaviour patterns in order to bring something positive into your love life. For example, if you have a tendency to pick bad partners due to low self-esteem you will need to build your self-confidence and let go of your self-sabotaging behaviours in order to allow a partner in to your life who will treat you with love and respect.Â
