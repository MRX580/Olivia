In a love Tarot spread, the Four of Pentacles reversed is a good omen. If you are in a relationship, it can indicate that you are letting go of fear and resentment in order to allow your relationship to move forward in a positive way. If you have been in a toxic relationship, it can be an indication of letting the relationship go. However, this should ultimately be a positive decision in your life if that is the case as it is something you need to do to move forward. If you are single, the Four of Pentacles reversed indicates that you are ready to let go of fear and get out there and meet people with an open heart. If you have been struggling to let go of feelings for an ex it can be an indication that you are ready to release those feelings and move forward in a positive way.
