In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the King of Wands reversed can indicate that you are in a relationship with someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. If this is your partner, beware as the extreme negative of this card can indicate an abusive relationship, a violent partner or a partner who is a womaniser. It can also indicate that your partner is severely commitment phobic and may flake on you or break promises. However, this card can also indicate that you and your partner need to think through what you want to get out of your relationship and go for it rather than sitting on the side-lines waiting for it to fall into your lap. If you are single, the King of Wands reversed can indicate that you will meet someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. Beware as this Minor Arcana card when reversed can indicate a bully, a womaniser or an abusive or violent man. However, it can also simply indicate that the person you are interested in may have some big commitment issues or lack confidence and as such you are going to have to tread carefully if you want to start a relationship with them as if you are too forceful they will run away. Show them that you are independent and fun. They fear being trapped or overburdened so if you show that you are self-sufficient, they may overcome their fears. Â
