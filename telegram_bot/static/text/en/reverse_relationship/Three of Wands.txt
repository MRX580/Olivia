In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Three of Wands reversed is not a good omen as it signifies lack of progress, lack growth or being disappointed with your choices so your relationship may not be going well when it appears. It can also signify feeling like your wings have been clipped   so if you or your partner would like to travel, you may feel that the other is restricting or holding you back. It can also signify a failed long distance relationship. If you are single, the Three of Wands indicates that you are holding on to the past or being haunted by it and this is affecting your ability to embrace being single and enjoy the freedom and adventure of it. It can also signify a failed holiday romance, breaking up with a new love you met while travelling or a failed long distance relationship.
