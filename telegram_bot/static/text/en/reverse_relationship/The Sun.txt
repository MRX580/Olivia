In a love context, if you are in a relationship, The Sun reversed can indicate that you are feeling left out in the cold by your partner. Some of the spark or passion may have gone out of the relationship. It can be an indication of a broken engagement or cancelled wedding. It may indicate that you are finding it difficult to see a way forward for you and your partner. It can also signify jealousy or trying to score points off each other. Try to focus on the positive things in the relationship, spend quality time together and remind yourself of why you got together in the first place. If you are single, The Sun reversed can be an indicator that you have become so egotistical that you are putting off potential partners. Trying to impress a potential partner may actually be having the opposite effect as it may come across that you are constantly bragging. Just dial it back a bit. They will respond much more favourably if you drop that ego, just be yourself!
