In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, the Two of Swords reversed indicates that you may be experiencing emotional turmoil about a decision you need to make regarding your relationship leading you to become completely indecisive. Anxiety or fear may be overwhelming you to the point that you are emotionally detaching from your partner rather than deal with the issues at hand. It also signify holding onto anxiety, problems or resentment. It may be that you are papering over the cracks in your relationship rather than dealing things and drawing a line under them, which leads to resentment. Alternatively, it can also represent finally seeing the truth of a situation after a period of being unable to move forward. If that is the case, you can now take steps in a positive direction but do so gentle at a pace that is comfortable for you and your partner, don’t force it. If you are single, the Two of Swords reversed can indicate that you may be experiencing overwhelming anxiety regarding dating which may be causing you to avoid it altogether. Perhaps you haven’t dated in a while and feel like you are out of practice or perhaps you are still processing the emotional turmoil from your last relationship or holding onto some resentment and aren’t quite ready to move forward yet. Don’t avoid the situation but be gentle with yourself. Get out and meet people without putting too much pressure on yourself to start something if you are not ready yet. Be patient and ease yourself into it. For instance, you could have casual low-key dates until you feel more comfortable such as meeting your date for a coffee or inviting your date along to a party so that it’s not a one-on-one situation.
