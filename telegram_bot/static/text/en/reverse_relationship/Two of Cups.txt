In a love Tarot reading, if you are single, the Two of Cups Tarot card reversed can signify a romance with someone who you are incompatible with. It can indicate that someone you are dating may blow hot and cold on you. You may find that they can’t get enough of you one minute and disappear or give you the cold shoulder the next. If you are in a relationship, the Two of Cups reversed is not a great omen as it can signify arguments, broken engagements, separation or divorce. It can signify that you and/or your partner have been taking the relationship for granted and not putting the work in. You may find yourself drawn to someone other than your partner. Alternately, you may find that you and your partner have become so co-dependent that it is creating resentment or arguments in your relationship. Whatever the issue, if you want your relationship to survive, this card tells you that you need to re-balance the relationship. Or you may need to rebalance yourself by getting your own emotions, issues or ego in check, which may naturally balance out the relationship. The Two of Cups reversed can, in some Tarot readings, signify abuse, dominance or controlling behaviour. Look to the supporting cards for confirmation of this.
