In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the King of Pentacles reversed indicates that you have failed to reach the level of security, comfort and stability you wanted from your relationship and this may be causing problems between you and your partner. Jealously, possessiveness, manipulation and controlling behaviour may all be issues in the relationship. If representing a person in the relationship, the King of Pentacles reversed can represent an older ungrounded man who may be impatient, irresponsible, unreliable, unstable and unsupportive. He can be disloyal and a cheater and may engage the services of prostitutes or be unfaithful with a mistress. He may neglect his partner and children either through his obsession with materialism and greed or through laziness, gambling or risky activities. He can be cold-hearted and ruthless and may use money as a means to control his partner or get what he wants. If you are single, the King of Pentacles reversed can indicate meeting someone who earns more than you or is of higher status than you and they may try to use this as a means of controlling you. This person may spoil you and shower you with gifts but there is an ulterior motive to their generosity. It can represent meeting someone who embodies the qualities of the King of Pentacles reversed, be careful.
