In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Queen of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you will be jealous or insecure in your relationship or that you and your partner may be bored or stuck in a rut. You or your partner may be expressing your insecurity be acting in a possessive or controlling manner. If representing a person in the relationship, this person may be unpleasant, lazy or boring and will expect her partner to do all the work in the relationship. Alternatively, she may be jealous, possessive, manipulative, shallow, spoiled, a social climber, a cheater and a sociopath.  She can be a neglectful or abusive mother.  If you are single, the Queen of Pentacles reversed indicates that you may need to work on yourself before you can find a healthy relationship. You may be lacking confidence or waiting for someone to come along who will provide you with the things you want rather than putting the effort into getting things yourself. If you enter a relationship on the basis of what you think someone can do for you or the security they can provide you, it will not go well as you will be in it for the wrong reasons. Even if they do provide you with what you want, you will not be equal partners and you could end up feeling insecure or possessive as you will have too much to lose if the relationship fails. Alternatively, it can indicate that you will meet a woman who embodies the qualities of the Queen of Pentacles reversed. If so, avoid her, she may seem charming but she could easily take your for everything you’re worth and destroy everything you hold dear in the process. It can also signify someone engaging the services of a prostitute.
