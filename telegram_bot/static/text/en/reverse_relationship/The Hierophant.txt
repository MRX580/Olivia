The Hierophant reversed in a love Tarot context may signify an unconventional relationship or the desire for one if you are single. You may be breaking with tradition by choosing not to marry. If you are in a relationship, it can also indicate a reversal of traditional gender roles. It can also indicate that you and your partner are not on the same page when it comes to values and goals. This may be causing conflict and insecurity in your relationship. Each of you need to stay open minded and try to understand where the other person is coming from.  Compromise is needed to bring about agreement without pushing either of you too far out of your comfort zone.
