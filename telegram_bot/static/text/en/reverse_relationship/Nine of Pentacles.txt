In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Nine of Pentacles reversed can indicate a lack of stability and security. It can be a sign that you or your partner are over indulging in things or being spoiled, running up bills and expecting the other to cover the expenses, as this card reversed often indicates someone who wants all the rewards without putting the work in. It can also indicate some sort of deceit or deception in a relationship. This card will appear often for people who are in a relationship for the wrong reasons, for example those who marry for money and status rather than love. It can simply be an indication that you and your partner have become too focused on the material or superficial aspects of life and need to get back to what’s really important and reconnect with each other. If you are single, the Nine of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you may be looking for a partner for the wrong reasons or being duped by someone who wants you for your wealth or status rather than being romantically interested in you. This Minor Arcana card can indicate a relationship involving a gold digger or someone who is materialist, superficial, cheap or tacky. This person may lack sophistication, elegance, grace or style. If you are wealthy, you need to be careful about who you trust and make sure you know their motives. This card can also represent a sex worker or a victim or survivor of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation.
