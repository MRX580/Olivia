In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, the Queen of Cups reversed can be a warning not to let your insecurities or lack of trust affect your relationship. If you have been acting clingy or needy you need to get back control of your emotions before you push your partner away. Alternately, if you have been rushing around trying to keep your partner happy, you need to remember to look after your own needs first or you will burn out. Try to find the emotional balance and do not allow others to take advantage of your good nature. If you are single, the Queen of Cups reversed is not a great omen as you may not be in a good place emotionally right now and may attract people who will seek to take advantage of your vulnerability! Take some time out to deal with any issues and find your own inner balance before you date anyone. If representing a person, the Queen of Cups reversed can be emotionally unstable or immature, needy, moody or sulky. She is generally not a great person to be around as she can be self-centred, manipulative or shallow. She can also be disloyal, unfaithful, vengeful, bitter and spiteful!Â
