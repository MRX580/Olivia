In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the Knight of Swords reversed can indicate that you are in a relationship with someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. Be careful if this is representing your partner as it can indicate that they are controlling, abusive, aggressive, violent or dangerous. This Minor Arcana card can also indicate that either you or your partner are feeling out of your depth in the relationship and may want to put the brakes on. If you are single, the Knight of Swords reversed can indicate that you will meet someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. Again, be very careful if this is the case as the reversed knight can be aggressive, vicious and dangerous. This card can also simply indicate that someone you are interested in will not be interested in pursuing a relationship at the moment or you may have to fight to get their attention.
