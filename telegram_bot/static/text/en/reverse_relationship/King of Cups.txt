In a love Tarot reading, if you are in relationship, the King of Cups reversed is not a great card to get as it can indicate you or your partner becoming emotionally unstable and cause problems in the relationship. One of you may be going through a tough time emotionally and may not be treating the other with the love and kindness they deserve. If that is the case, you may need to take some time to yourself to get control of your emotions and resolve whatever issues are causing this upheaval.  It can also represent cheating, perverted sexual behaviour or disloyalty and in the extreme negative can be a sign of abuse, rape or violence. If that is your situation, seek professional support to get away and create a safe and secure situation for yourself. If you are single, the King of Cups reversed is not a great card to get as it can indicate an affair with a married man. Alternatively, it can represent a potential partner who will be cold, calculating, controlling or will deceive you. It can also be a warning to be mindful of your personal safety when dating as it can be an indicator of violence or abuse and in extreme cases, rape or sexual assault. The man it represents is a great con artist and can appear to be quite charming and kind but he is a dangerous manipulator with a hidden dark side, beware! Alternately, it can indicate that a potential partner will be emotionally immature and become clingy and needy.
