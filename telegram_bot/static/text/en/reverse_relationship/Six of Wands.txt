In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Six of Wands reversed is not a great omen as it can indicate failure, disloyalty and instability. You relationship may lack the qualities needed to endure the difficult times. This Minor Arcana card when reversed can represent broken promises and disappointment. It suggests that you and your partner are not being very supportive of each otherâ€™s dreams, ambitions or goals and are not sharing your victories. Over inflated egos or arrogance may be at the root of the issue and one or both of you may be engaging in diva like behaviour leading to ill-will between you. If you are single, the Six of Wands reversed can indicate that you may be lacking in self-esteem which is hampering your efforts to meet someone you can have a relationship with. Alternatively, it can indicate that you are acting like a diva and this is putting off potential partners.
