The Magician reversed in the context of a love Tarot reading for those in relationships, can indicate that you need to be more open and honest with your partner about your needs and desires. If you are tempted to try and manipulate your partner to get what you want, don’t. Honesty will get you much further than trickery.  It can also indicate that partner/lover who appears to be trustworthy, may be using their influence over you to manipulate you for their own selfish reasons.  If you are single The Magician indicates that you may be becoming cynical about love and your future love life and feeling like you will never attract anyone good to your life. Don’t lose faith. If you stay positive and send love and light out into the world you will eventually attract the same back to you!
