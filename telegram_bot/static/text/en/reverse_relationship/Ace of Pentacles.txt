In a love Tarot spread, if you are single, the Ace of Pentacles reversed can be a warning not to miss out on opportunities for love in the future. It can also indicate that the loss of the security of a previous relationship may be leaving you feeling vulnerable and anxious. If you are dating at the moment, make sure you are making enough time to get to know the person as new relationships need time and attention in order to progress. If you are in relationship, the Ace of Pentacles reversed can represent insecurity and instability in the relationship. You may be feeling that your relationship is on shaky ground when it appears. Greed, selfishness or jealousy could be a factor. The Ace of Pentacles reversed can also indicate that you or your partner may not be giving the relationship the time and attention it needs as you are putting your energy in to career or material matters or that financial worries could be putting pressure on the relationship.
