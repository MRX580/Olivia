In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, The World reversed can indicate that your relationship has become stagnant. It may be that you and your partner have let things slide and you need to put more effort in to the relationship and having open and honest communication to get it back on track. If, however, you have been putting serious work into your relationship but it doesn’t seem to be getting any better, you may need to consider if this is the right relationship for you. If you are single, you may feel that your love life has fallen flat but ask yourself if you’ve been making enough effort to get out and meet the right people. Prince/Princess charming is not just going to knock on your door and sweep you off your feet. You have to get out and meet people. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there. The World reversed can also indicate that you are struggling to move on from a relationship that ended without warning. Perhaps a previous partner suddenly cut you off without warning or didn’t give you the time you needed to come to terms with the end of relationship. This can be incredibly difficult to deal with as you have not had an opportunity to get closure. Don’t wish your life away waiting for them to come back. You may never get closure from your previous partner so you must focus on finding another way to make your peace with what has happened. Ask the universe to help you in this and keep yourself open to opportunities for healing. You will get through it in time but it will take a big conscious effort on your part, so put your focus into that.
