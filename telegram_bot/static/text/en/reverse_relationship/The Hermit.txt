The Hermit reversed in a love Tarot context is strong indicator of loneliness. If you are in a relationship it suggests that you may be feeling shut out or rejected by your partner. It can also indicate that you and your partner are so busy that you have no time to connect. This may be leading you to feel lonely even though you are in a relationship. It can also suggest one person withdrawing from a relationship while the other is still trying to hold on to it. If you are single, The Hermit reversed can indicate that you fear being left on the shelf or you feel you may have missed your window of opportunity to meet someone special. The Hermit in reverse can indicate that now is time to start looking for love after a being single for a long time. You need to put aside your fears and put yourself out there again. Â If you have recently broken up with your partner it can be a sign that you want to get back together with your ex.
