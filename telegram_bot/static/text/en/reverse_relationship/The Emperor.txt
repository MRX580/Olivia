If you are in a relationship, The Emperor Tarot card reversed in a love Tarot reading can indicate an imbalance of power in the relationship which is causing conflict or unhappiness. It can signify one partner controlling the other, being possessive, stubborn or overbearing. This type of behaviour will lead to the other partner feeling trapped. The Emperor reversed shows that there needs to be balance between wanting structure in a relationship and being a control freak. Learn to compromise! If you are single, The Emperor reversed can indicate that your father issues are leading to destructive patterns in your choice of partners. You need to resolve these issues to avoid attracting those who would seek to take advantage of you. It can also indicate a lack of commitment, flitting from one partner to another and a lack of monogamy, in essence rebelling again what The Emperor represents. Â
