In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, Temperance reversed can indicate conflict and clashes caused by an imbalance in the relationship. This may be a result of one of you feeling like you care more than the other or feeling like the love and respect you show your partner is not reciprocated. There is a lack of harmony in the relationship and you may find that you are arguing with each other, that you’re not willing to listen to each other.  You may also find yourselves being outright antagonistic with each other and trying to point score rather than working together to resolve your issues. Try to calm the situation down and find your own inner balance so that you can better cope with the issues you are facing and make yourself more open to finding solutions. If you are single, Temperance reversed can indicate that you are giving too much of yourself too soon to the people you’re interested in. This can be simply that you’re trying too hard or coming across as too eager or it can indicate promiscuity or coming across as completely desperate! Try to be patient if you’re looking for love. Don’t be hasty or try to force a relationship before you’ve gotten to know someone properly. Just relax, try to find your own inner balance and let any new romance develop at its own pace.
