In a love Tarot reading, the Five of Pentacles reversed is a good omen to get. If you are in a relationship, it can indicate that you are overcoming previous struggles. That can take the form of improving the relationship at a steady pace and making positive changes. It can also mean making a decision, to free yourself from a relationship that’s no longer good for you. If your relationship initially caused a scandal, this card indicates that you should find people around you becoming more accepting of the relationship. If you are single, the Five of Pentacles reversed is a positive card to get in a love Tarot spread as it indicates that you are coming out the other side of a period of loneliness or feeling rejected. You will be making positive changes in your life and feeling much more open to the romantic possibilities all around you. You are ready to embrace a new relationship and take a chance on love. This positive energy will attract others to you.
