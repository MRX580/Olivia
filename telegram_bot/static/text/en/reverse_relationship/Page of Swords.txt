In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the Page of Swords reversed can indicate that your partner may be playing mind games, be cold or uncaring in their treatment of you or bringing emotional baggage from a previous relationship into your relationship which is causing conflict or making them paranoid. Do not allow your partner to punish you for the treatment they received from a past partner. If you are waiting on news or a development in your relationship, this card can tell you that you may be disappointed with the outcome. If you are single, the Page of Swords reversed can indicate that you may become interested in someone who is a game player and will expect you to compete to be with them possibly against another lover. If you have been hoping for a relationship, this card can tell you that you may be disappointed with the outcome.
