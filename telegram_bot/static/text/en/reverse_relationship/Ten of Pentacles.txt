In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Ten of Pentacles reversed is not a great omen as it can be an indication of instability, insecurity or divorce. Your relationship may be based on rocky foundations or you may be neglecting your relationship for materialistic pursuits when this card appears in your Tarot reading. Or it can simply signify that you may be questioning whether your relationship will be stable in the long term. It is also the Minor Arcana card of domestic disputes or disharmony and can indicate that you and your partner may be having arguments over money or finding that financial burdens are putting a strain on your relationship. This card can signify an unconventional or non-traditional approach to family values or relationships. The Ten of Pentacles reversed can also represent marrying for money rather than love. If you are single, the Ten of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you are not looking for a long term relationship or may not be ready for a committed relationship. At this point, you may just want a fun, casual relationship. Alternatively, it can indicate that a non-traditional or unconventional relationship may be on the horizon.Â
