In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Five of Wands reversed can represent an ending of rows, arguments, conflict or fighting. You and your partner may be starting to turn a corner after a period of turbulence in the relationship. This Minor Arcana card reversed can indicate that you have found common ground and solutions to your issues and that has led to peace and harmony in the relationship. It can also indicate one or both of you may have learned to suppress your tempers and cooperate. However, the card reversed can also signify an abusive relationship as it can represent feeling intimidated, extreme aggression, a lover with a short fuse and fear of confrontation. If that is the case, you should contact organisations who can help or family and friends for support immediately. Don’t suffer in silence! If you are single, the Five of Wands reversed can indicate that your love life is lacking passion or spark at the moment. You may find that you’ve gone from having many potential suitors to having none as things have fizzled out or you find yourself feeling shy or intimidated by the dating world. Don’t be afraid, get out there and meet new people. What have you got to lose?
