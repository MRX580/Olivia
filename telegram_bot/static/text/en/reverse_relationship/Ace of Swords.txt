In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the Ace of Swords reversed can indicate conflict or confusion in a relationship. This Minor Arcana card reversed can tell you that miscommunication or a lack of communication may simply be causing issues in your relationship. However it can also indicate a more deep-seated hostility or resentment leading to insults, arguments and in extreme cases, the destruction of the relationship. If you are single, the Ace of Swords reversed indicates that you may meet someone soon who may have an attitude or mind-set regarding relationships that conflicts with your own. For example, if you are seeking a committed relationship you may find yourself dating someone who only wants a fling or casual-relationship or vice versa. You may find yourself making the wrong decision or choosing potential partners who do not share your values or beliefs or you may simply not be in the right mind-set at the moment to form a healthy romantic relationship.
