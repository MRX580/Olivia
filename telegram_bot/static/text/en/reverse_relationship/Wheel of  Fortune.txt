In a love context, if you are in a relationship the Wheel of Fortune Tarot reversed can represent stagnancy or the sparkle going out of the relationship. That doesn’t mean that you should automatically make a knee-jerk decision to end the relationship as all relationships have their ups and downs. You may just be moving from one phase of a relationship to another and this could be a little slump in between. Try and assess the situation and find what works for you. Either way this time of upheaval shall pass. Previous mistakes may come back and cause issues. If you are single and feel you have been unlucky in relationships, you need to look at your own choices and behaviour. Have you thrown away opportunities for love? If so, learn from your mistakes and you will get another chance at happiness. We choose the lessons we are meant to learn in this life and you can change your luck by learning from your past and applying these karmic lessons to your future. Whether you are single or in a relationship, the Wheel of Fortune Tarot card in a reversed position is a sign that you may experience setbacks or delays. Try to go with the flow, the only way is up.
