The Strength Tarot reversed in a love Tarot reading if you are single can indicate that lack of impulse control or unresolved self-esteem issues may be leading you to choose the wrong partners. This can become a vicious circle as bad relationships negatively affect your self-esteem. You need to resolve these issues and summon your inner strength and confidence and believe that you deserve better. If you are in a relationship, Strength reversed can indicate that while your relationship is strong, low self-esteem may be leaving you feeling unworthy of the love you are receiving. This in turn may lead you to act impulsively and behave in manner that is not a true reflection of the feelings you have for your partner. Donâ€™t let your anxiety or fear create problems where there are none.
