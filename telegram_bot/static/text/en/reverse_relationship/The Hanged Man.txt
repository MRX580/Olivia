If you are single, The Hanged Man in a reversed position can indicate that you have been repeating the same negative relationship patterns over and over without learning from your mistakes. You may be rushing from bad relationship to the next and never taking responsibility for the role you play in choosing these relationships. Try to slow down, figure out why this pattern keeps continuing and what you need to resolve within yourself to change it. If you are in a relationship, The Hanged Man can indicate that your relationship may not be working but you or your partner may be holding onto it for fear of being alone or starting over. It can also indicate that the relationship could be salvageable but you are not currently prepared to confront the issues you are experiencing.
