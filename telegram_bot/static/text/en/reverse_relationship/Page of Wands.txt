In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Page of Wands reversed can indicate that setback in a relationship. This Minor Arcana card reversed can indicate that the initial romance has worn off and you are seriously considering if you and your partner have enough in common to make a relationship work. You may simply need to reinject the passion or get to know each other better to strengthen the relationship on a deeper level or you may decide to end it. Don’t push for a commitment when this card appears as it’s not the right time. Rather put some fun and energy back into the relationship. The Page of Wands reversed can sometimes indicate that your partner’s attention may be starting to wander or they may not be putting your feelings first and are being a little selfish or lazy. If you are single, the Page of Wands reversed suggests a lack of energy or enthusiasm in your love life. It can indicate that you are not putting the effort into finding someone or you are just not all that interested in starting a relationship, which may be coming across if you go dates. Alternatively, it can indicate that you may hear disappointing news in relation to someone you are interested in, such as negative rumours or gossip. Don’t believe everything you hear as you don’t know what motivation people may have for starting a rumour. Consider giving your love interest the benefit of the doubt and get to know them. If the rumours are true you will soon find out for yourself.
