In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Five of Swords reversed can indicate that you and your partner may be putting an end to some conflict in your relationship, learning to compromise and overcoming challenges. You may be letting bygones be bygones in respect of any arguments or issues you have been having and learning to communicate with each other but be aware, this peace requires work to make it last. If you return, to previous patterns you will sabotage the progress you have made. On the flip side, the Five of Swords reversed can be an indication of a complete breakdown in communication and succumbing to challenges in the relationship. If either of you has been unfaithful or underhanded in the relationship, this card can indicate that you will be exposed quite publicly as it indicates public shaming, revenge, remorse and regret. If you are in an abusive relationship, this card tells you to heed the warning that you are in danger! Get out before it escalates into serious violence. If you are single, the Five of Swords reversed indicates that you may have realised that you have been too critical or dismissive of a potential partner and may now be willing to give them a chance or they you. Alternatively, it can indicate that you have decided that a potential partner is not at all right for you and are letting them go.
