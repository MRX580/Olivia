The overall message of The Chariot reversed in a love Tarot reading is slow down! If you are a relationship and things aren’t progressing as fast as you would like you need to have patience and be confident that things will progress in their own time. Forcing things could be disastrous. Likewise, if you are feeling pressure into moving your relationship to the next level, don’t allow yourself to be coerced. Take a step back and consider what you are ready for. Be clear with your partner and set boundaries. If you are single, you may meet someone soon but the same message applies, don’t rush things. Enjoy the excitement of a new relationship and take time to get to know your new love interest without piling on the pressure. Sometimes it’s better to just go with the flow and let things evolve at their own pace.
