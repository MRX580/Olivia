In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Page of Pentacles reversed tells you to beware as there is potential for disloyalty or unfaithfulness in your relationship. It can be an indication of a lack of maturity or a moody or sullen temperament on either your part or your partner’s. If you deceive or mistreat your partner you will lose them and may live to regret it. There is also a sense of boredom or frustration indicated with this card so you may need to put some work in to making the relationship fun again. If you are single, the Page of Pentacles reversed tells you that you are not ready for a serious relationship at the moment and that’s OK as long as you are honest with potential partners. Have fun and enjoy yourself.
