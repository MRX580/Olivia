In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Four of Swords reversed can indicate that your relationship is slowly recovering after a difficult period. Alternatively, it can indicate that the stress and anxiety you and your partner are experiencing has spiralled and is pushing your relationship to breaking point. Look to supporting card to confirm this. If you are single, the Four of Sword reversed can indicate a period of recovery and healing after releasing yourself from a bad relationship or the end of the mourning period after bereavement. You are slowly getting ready to come out of isolation and re-join the world. Alternatively, it can indicate that your fears and anxieties have gotten to you so much that you have completely lost faith that you will ever have a happy relationship. You may need to accept counselling or support, even though you do not believe it will do any good, it may help you get some perspective and positivity back so you can move forward.
