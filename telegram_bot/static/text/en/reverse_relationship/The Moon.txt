If you are in relationship, The Moon reversed can indicate deception or lies being unveiled. This could be an affair being exposed. It can also simply be an indication of the truth of your relationship coming to light. Perhaps you have been deceiving yourself about the current state of the relationship or blinding yourself to certain things about your partner. If so, The Moon reversed shows that you will see your partner’s true character or the truth about your relationship. If you are single, The Moon reversed can be an indicator that you are starting to regain your composure and self-confidence after a period of uncertainty. It can also be an indicator that you may be ignoring signs or your instincts that a potential partner is not suitable for you. An example of this would be noticing warning signs that the person you’re dating is married or involved but ignoring the signs because you don’t want to believe it.
