In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Knight of Cups reversed is not a good omen as it can indicate the end of a relationship, a broken engagement or a romantic proposal of some sort being revoked. The negative aspects of the reversed Knight of Cups can take many forms: Â a partner who turns from happy and committed to suddenly commitment-phobic, a partner who is a heartbreaker or cheater or a partner who becomes obsessive, abusive or misogynistic. It can also represent you becoming any of these things to your partner and can indicate drug or alcohol abuse being an issue in a relationship. Look to the supporting cards for further clarification as to the type of reversed Knight you are dealing with. If you are single, the Knight of Cups Tarot card reversed is not much better. You may find yourself dating a person with the issues listed above. It can also be an indicator that you are in love with someone who does not return your feelings or are engaging in one night stands even though you know that these encounters do not offer you the love you desire. Alternately, the Knight of Cups reversed can simply be an indication of homosexuality.
