In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Knight of Pentacles reversed is a not good indicator as it signifies an unstable relationship that may be lacking commitment or effort. It can signify things becoming a little dull or boring when it appears. If you want the relationship to last you need to inject some passion into it. If representing a person in the relationship, this person may be lazy, weak, a gambler or a loser. He may be disloyal, unfaithful or still want to play the field. He may be interested in his partner for wealth or social status and while he may talk about building a comfortable lifestyle, he will lack the work ethic, commitment or focus to achieve it. He will break the promises he makes. Alternatively, he may be so materialistic and money focused that he neglects his partner and comes across as dull and boring. If you are single, the Knight of Pentacles reversed signifies that you are not ready for stability and commitment. This is fine as long as you let your potential partners know before they get too invested. It can also indicate that someone who fits the Knight’s reversed qualities may be coming your way! You would do well to steer clear of this person as he may not be trustworthy and could lead you into trouble.
