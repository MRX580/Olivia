In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Two of Wands reversed indicates that you or your partner may be finding your relationship mundane and boring but you are staying together because you see it as the safest bet. This Minor Arcana card reversed can also signify that the relationship may be holding you back but you are afraid to leave as you fear the unknown. This card is also a travel card but when it reverses it can indicate that you or your partner is considering going travelling or emigrating but the other wants to stay put. This could lead to a breakup when it appears in your Tarot reading. Alternatively, if your partner has been withdrawn or detached the Two of Wands reversed could be an indication of a sudden turnaround where your partner re-engages with the relationship. If you are single, the Two of Wands reversed can indicate that you will have a choice between staying single or getting back with your ex. You may feel like your options are restricted at the moment but there are more choices out there than you realise. Alternatively, like the upright version, the Two of Wands reversed can indicate that you will have a choice between two lovers but the reversed can indicate that you will choose the safest bet.
