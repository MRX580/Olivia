In a general context, the Eight of Wands reversed represents slowness, slow progress and lack of speed, movement or action. When reversed, it is a Minor Arcana card of restriction, returning from travels or delayed or cancelled travel or holidays. It can signify late starts, bad timing, losing momentum, missed opportunities and unfinished business. Whatever you turn your hand to at the moment probably wonâ€™t work out the way you want it to. You may be feeling negativity or a lack of energy when it appears in your Tarot spread. The Eight of Wands reversed also represents being hysterical, impatient, impulsive and panicked or out of control. It can represent dislike or a lack of passion, excitement or romance. It can also signify being grounded.
