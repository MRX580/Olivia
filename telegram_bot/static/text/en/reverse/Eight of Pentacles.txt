In a general context, the Eight of Pentacles Tarot card reversed can indicate laziness, idleness, carelessness, lack of effort or poor concentration. Alternatively, it can indicate focusing on one area to such an extreme that you neglect the other areas of your life such as being mean and materialistic and neglecting your love life or family life or your soul. When this Minor Arcana card appears in your Tarot reading, it indicates that you are not focusing on what you want to achieve or aren’t putting the work in that needed to achieve your goals or that you are spreading yourself too thin which is leading to failure. Try to set yourself goals, prioritise what you really want to achieve and take tasks one at a time. Lack of ambition, respect or confidence can all be signified by this Minor Arcana card in reverse.
