In a general context, the Judgement Tarot card reversed can signify that you are allowing fear and self-doubt to hold you back from making the decisions necessary to move forward in a positive direction. Now is the time to take action. If you delay you may lose the opportunities available to you. Alternately, this Major Arcana card in a reversed position can be a sign that you may be refusing to learn the karmic lessons of the past. Or you may be reproaching yourself for past mistakes so much that you are unable to see the lessons to be learned from those mistakes. Judgement reversed can also be a sign that you are taking your focus off your own shortcomings by being overly critical of others or engaging in malicious gossip. This will only lead you to trouble, try to put the focus back on fixing the issues in your own life rather than judging other people for their mistakes. It can also indicate that others are being overly judgemental or critical of you or blaming you for something that wasn’t your fault. Don’t let those people influence your decisions, rise above the drama and focus on doing what you want to do. Judgement reversed can also indicate that a legal matter or court case will be resolved but in an unjust or unfair manner.
