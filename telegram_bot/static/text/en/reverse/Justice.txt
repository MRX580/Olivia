In a general context, Justice reversed can indicate injustice or avoidance of karmic justice. This may take the form of being treated unjustly in your life or situation where you are being unfairly affected by the choices or actions of others. You may feel you are being victimised or blamed for something that is not your fault. Whatever the situation, you must try to maintain your balance. Even if you didn’t create the situation, you can choose how you react to it and that can be a lesson in itself. Justice in a reversed position can also be an indicator of someone trying to avoid their karma. If you have played a part in creating your current situation by bad choices or actions, you must be accountable. Don’t try to blame others or avoid the consequences, just learn from it and move forward a little wiser and more self-aware. The Justice Tarot card reversed can also indicate dishonesty. If you have been caught out in a lie, don’t try to justify it or lie your way out of it. Just confess, accept the consequences and try to draw a line under it. Justice reversed can indicate someone with very hard-line or uncompromising views. Examine if you or those around you may have become prejudiced. Examine this and determine is this how you want to be or what you want in your life? If you are involved in a legal dispute, it is not a favourable card to get and indicates that there will be some form of injustice in the outcome or the outcome will not be what you had hoped for.
