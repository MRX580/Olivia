In a general context, the Six of Pentacles reversed Tarot card can represent lack of generosity, meanness or gifts that come with strings or conditions attached.Â  Someone in your life may be showing you generosity but have ulterior motives or they may be in a position to help you but they may be abusing that position or trying to make you subservient to them. If you are in a position of power, it can be an indication that you are using your power for ill means. This Minor Arcana card reversed can signify lack of charity or community spirit. It can also represent fake charities, scams, extortion or being conned. When it appears you may need to assess if you are going to the extreme of being too greedy or mean or the other extreme of being too generous or gullible. It can also indicate that you are grovelling or being a kiss-ass to someone with wealth, power or authority or someone is behaving that way towards you.
