In a general Tarot spread, the King of Pentacles reversed represents losing your grip on things, not reaching your goals or not seeing things through to the end. This Minor Arcana card reversed can represent losing your social status, failure or lack of success, being impractical, unprincipled, taking ill-advised risks, making hasty decisions or having poor judgement. As a person, the King of Pentacles reversed can represent an older unsuccessful or ungrounded man. There can be two extremes of the King of Pentacles in a reversed position. The first is an older male who is a slob, lazy, bad in business or has poor judgement. This King is usually broke, a gambler or unsuccessful risk-taker who is weak and in his extreme negative a complete deadbeat. The other is an older male who is ruthless and corrupt. His greed knows no bounds. He is usually unfaithful. He is a hypocritical cheater who will try to hold everyone around him to exacting standards that he would never reach himself. He is a miser and a money grabber and a terrible father as his obsession with materialism makes him cold, uncaring and unsupportive. HeÂ may be an Earth sign such as Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.
