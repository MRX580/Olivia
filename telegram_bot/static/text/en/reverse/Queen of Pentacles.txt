She signifies a lack of common sense or an impractical, dangerous or chaotic approach to life. As a person, the Queen of Pentacles reversed can represent a mature female or feminine person who is mean-spirited and materialistic and who can be spoiled, shallow and pretentious. She can be possessive, jealous, envious or a social climber or in her extreme state, a manipulative sociopath who will step on anyone to get what she wants. She can simply represent a woman who is unpleasant to be around, disorganised, lazy, bad with money or boring. On the other hand, when reversed this woman can appear charming and pleasant but beneath her charm there is a sinister undertone of disloyalty, evilness, wickedness, chaos and danger.

This card can also represent a cheating woman, a neglectful or abusive mother and a bad cook or a careless hostess. She may be an Earth sign such as Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.
