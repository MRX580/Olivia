In a general context, the Eight of Swords reversed can represent release, freedom, escape and finding solutions and options. It signifies relieving pressure, releasing anxiety and facing fears and truths. When reversed, it is a Minor Arcana card of self-belief, ignoring criticism, standing up to abuse and taking back control.  You may be feeling clear minded, empowered, mentally strong and hopeful when this card appears in your Tarot spread. This card indicates that you may find you are ready for healing, to ask for help and to overcome obstacles.  It can also represent release from prison and the end of a punishment.  However, on the flip side the Eight of Swords reversed card can be an indication of extreme oppression, surrendering to pressure or being completely paralysed by fear and severe depression.
