In a general context, the Knight of Wands reversed indicates that things are not going as well as you expected and any ventures you have taken on are likely to experience delays or setback.  You may be lacking ambition, enthusiasm or self-discipline to make your ventures a success and could be feeling fearful and passive when it appears in your Tarot reading. Alternatively, it can indicate that you are being overly confident or competitive, arrogant or cocky. It tells you not to be reckless or overly hasty as it may not be the right time to put your plans into action. It can also indicate that you may be heading for a fall so slow down and put the brakes on before it’s too late. This Minor Arcana card signifies not finishing what you started. It is also a card of cancelled or delayed travel or sudden unexpected departures. As a person, the Knight of Wands reversed is an adult (20-35 years of age and usually male) who may be extremely hasty, arrogant, egotistical, reckless, hyperactive and a daredevil. He may be overly confident, loud, over the top and a show off and could lack self-discipline and self-control.  He may be a fire sign such as Aries, Leo or Sagittarius. On the flip side he may be passive, fearful and may lack enthusiasm, ambition, imagination and purpose and have a chip on his shoulder. In the extreme negative he can be violent, abusive, jealous, volatile, extremely aggressive, overly competitive and domineering.
