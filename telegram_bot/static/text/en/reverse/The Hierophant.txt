When The Hierophant Tarot appears reversed it is time to break with convention. You will want to change traditional structure, social norms and rigid rules. Those close to you may not understand this need to challenge the established way of doing things and may be completely against it but with this Major Arcana card appearing in your Tarot reading you will feel compelled to think for yourself and throw away the rule book. The Hierophant reversed can signify an unconventional way of living or an alternative lifestyle. Alternatively, it may indicate that you are clinging desperately to old ways to your detriment or it may indicate that you have feelings of guilt and shame associated with behaving in a way that goes against the values you were raised with. Learning to live by your own rules, while still listening to your own conscience, will bring you freedom from oppression. It will open your mind and expand your horizons in a positive way.  The Hierophant reversed can also be an indicator of conflict with a person in a position of authority.
