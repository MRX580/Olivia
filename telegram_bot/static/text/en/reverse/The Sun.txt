In a general context, The Sun Tarot card reversed can indicate sadness, depression and pessimism. You may be finding it difficult to focus on the positive with this card in your Tarot reading. The Sun reversed does not usually mean that your situation or circumstances are all that bad but that you are feeling pessimistic and focusing on the negative which is affecting your outlook on life. It can signify a lack of enthusiasm for life, being unclear on the right path to take or being unable to see the way forward. This Major Arcana card may show that you are letting negative energy/thoughts close you off to the happiness and joy that is all around you. You have the power to change this by simply allowing yourself to be open to the positive things that are coming your way and by finding gratitude for the good things in your life.  The Sun reversed can also be an indicator of being overly enthusiastic or confident to the point that it becomes a negative trait. For example, you may be being so overly confident that you are actually becoming egotistical or arrogant. Or you may be so enthusiastic about achieving your goals that you haven’t stopped to check if they are actually realistic.
