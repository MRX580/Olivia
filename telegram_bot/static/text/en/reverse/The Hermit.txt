The Hermit Tarot card reversed suggests that you have withdrawn too much from the world or are becoming too reclusive. Solitude might have been necessary or good for you at one point but The Hermit reversed is telling you that it is time to come back to the world and the people around you. Taking time for soul-searching and self-reflection can be a great thing in moderation but too much can be damaging. At some point, you do need to draw a line under things and move forward, this Major Arcana card in reversed position indicates that now is that time. It can also indicate that you may be feeling shy or apprehensive about being in social situations. Don’t be afraid to get back out there. Alternatively, The Hermit in reversed can indicate that you are avoiding self-reflection completely as you are afraid of what you’ll discover if you look inside yourself. It can be an indicator of becoming too fixated with someone or something or too rigid and restricted in your views.
