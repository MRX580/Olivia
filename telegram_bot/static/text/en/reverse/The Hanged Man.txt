The Hanged Man reversed can indicate that you are being impulsive and making rash decisions as a way to distract yourself from some sort of inner discontentment. This Major Arcana trump card generally shows that you may be jumping from one bad situation to the next without considering where this behaviour is taking you. Ask yourself if there are feelings you trying to avoid confronting or changes that you know need to be made but are reluctant to tackle. If there are, consider what you fear will happen if you do? If you genuinely don’t know what to do in terms of your direction in life, just stop, breathe and wait for things to become clearer. However, if you know your behaviour patterns are not working for you, change them. Your attitude towards your life will determine life’s attitude towards you!
