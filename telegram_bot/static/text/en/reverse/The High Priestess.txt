As with the upright meaning, The High Priestess reversed in a tarot reading indicates your intuition is trying to guide you and your instincts are correct. However, in the reversed position this Major Arcana card shows that you are not hearing it. You may be more focused on the opinions of others or winning other people’s approval than your own inner wisdom. It can also indicate that you are neglecting your own needs to take care of others. You need to take the time to connect with yourself and listen to your inner voice. Trust yourself. You have all the wisdom and knowledge you need.
