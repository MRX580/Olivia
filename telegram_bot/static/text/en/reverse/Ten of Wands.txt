In a general context, the Ten of Wands reversed represents having too much responsibility and stress or a cross that’s too heavy to bear. When reversed, this Minor Arcana card can signify insurmountable problems, flogging a dead horse and working hard but getting nowhere. It suggests that you are pushing yourself so far that you are on the brink of a collapse or a breakdown. It can also indicate being duty bound and resigned to your fate or having no stamina and not being up to the challenges you are facing. Alternatively, it can represent letting go, learning to say no, off-loading, dumping and shirking duties or responsibilities.
