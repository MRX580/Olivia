In a general context, the Page of Pentacles reversed can be the bearer of bad news in earthly matters. However, often it is an indicator that your present challenges are not due to some outside or unseen force, but rather a consequence of your own behaviour or inaction. It can indicate that lack of goals or lack of follow through may be holding you back and preventing you from reaching your potential. Laziness, foolishness, frustration and impatience are also represented by this card. The message with this Minor Arcana card reversed is to stop procrastinating and go after what you want. The world will not just deliver your destiny to you. You have to ride out to meet it. If you want to achieve your dreams you have to seize every opportunity that comes your way. If representing a person, the Page of Pentacles reversed represents a young person, child or person who is young at heart, who is lazy, immature, disloyal, irresponsible, sullen or rebellious, who has little common sense and poor prospects.Â They may be an Earth sign such as Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn.
