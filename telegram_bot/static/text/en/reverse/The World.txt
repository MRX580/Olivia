In a general context, The World Tarot card reversed can indicate that you have not accomplished what you set out to do and things have become stagnant. You may have tried to take shortcuts instead of putting in the hard work necessary to achieve your dreams. You may be throwing all your energy into trying to make something work that is not working for you. The World reversed can signify feeling stuck in a situation. This will be one particular part of your life that is taking up your energy rather than problems in all areas. You may be aware of what is it already as it will be a focus for you and you may feel burdened by it. Remember that there is no point in flogging a dead horse. So if you’ve thrown everything you’ve got a something and it’s still not working for you, The World reversed may be telling you that it’s time to accept the disappointment and cut your losses.
