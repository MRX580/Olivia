In a general context, Death reversed indicates that you are resisting a change that is necessary for you to move forward. Nothing new can begin while you are holding on to this old negative energy. Death indicates that while you are finding it difficult to let go, once you do, new energy will come into your life to give you a new brighter beginning. The change the Death Tarot card reversed brings is not something you can resist forever, if you keep holding onto the things you should be letting go of, the universe will find a way to push you on to your life path in its own way. The universe’s way of getting you to where you’re supposed to be, if you resist it, can be shocking and distressing. It’s much better to make you way to your correct path rather than getting a jolt that forces you onto it. At least if you make a decision to let go of old situations, old issues or relationships you will feel empowered that you made a decision to end what wasn’t working for you. When you think of the change you are resisting, ask yourself realistically is it going to make you feel worse than staying in your current situation indefinitely or could it possibly lead you to something amazing?
