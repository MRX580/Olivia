When The Empress reversed appears in a Tarot reading, it again tells you to embrace your feminine qualities. This applies to men too. We are all a mixture of masculine and feminine qualities. The Empress reversed indicates that you have been suppressing or neglecting your feminine side and need to embrace it in order to bring your masculine and feminine energies into balance. You may be focusing too much on the material and mental aspects of life, rather than the emotional and spiritual when this Major Arcana card appears. The disharmony indicated by The Empress reversed can take many forms. You may be putting others needs before your own to your detriment. Or you may feel so emotionally overwhelmed that you are neglecting those that are important to you. You may also feel unattractive and undesirable and your confidence has taken a knock. You will need to shift the focus and ground yourself to correct this imbalance. It can be a signifier of empty-nest syndrome for the parents of grown up children. It can also be an indicator of mother issues affecting you depending on its placement in a Tarot spread.
