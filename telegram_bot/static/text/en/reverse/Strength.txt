When the Strength Tarot card appears reversed in your Tarot reading, it indicates that you are not tapping into the inner strength you have. It is does not indicate a lack of strength so much as it indicates that you are letting fear, anxiety or low self-esteem paralyse you. Now more than ever you need to summon your inner resolve and self-belief to pull you out of your current situation. You have the strength you need to get over your obstacles. You have simply lost touch with it and that disconnection is leaving you feeling weak, vulnerable and lacking confidence. Focus on the positive, stay away from people who make you feel inadequate and spend time with people who build you up.Â
