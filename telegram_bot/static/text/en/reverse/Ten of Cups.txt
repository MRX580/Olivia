In a general Tarot reading, the Ten of Cups Tarot card reversed is not a great omen. The love, harmony and contentment have disappeared and are replaced with discontent, arguments and conflict. The Ten of Cups reversed can generally refer to an unhappy home life, broken home or dysfunctional family situation. It can indicate family breakdowns, problems within a family, neglect or abuse. The Ten of Cups reversed can be an indicator of family relationships not being as stable as they may appear outwardly. There may be secrets, problems and/or disharmony and someone may be trying to keep up appearances when this Minor Arcana appears. It can also represent infertility or miscarriage. On the lighter side, it can simply represent a non-traditional family situation or a foster family.  It can also signify homesickness or feeling isolated.
