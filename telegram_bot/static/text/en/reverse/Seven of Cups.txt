In a general context, the Seven of Cups Tarot card reversed can indicate that you are finding clarity and getting back to reality after a period of indulging in fantasies or living in a dream world. You may be finally starting to act decisively and to see the correct path for you clearly, having previously felt indecisive or lost. It represents getting a reality check. Alternately, when this Minor Arcana appears reversed in your Tarot spread it can indicate that you may have a lack of options, choices or opportunities or you may be feeling restricted or trapped in some way.
