As with the upright meaning, The Fool reversed signifies a new beginning. However, when reversed this Major Arcana trump card indicates that theÂ beginning is something you may be reluctant to jump into. This new beginning is still coming either way! The Fool tarot card reversed can be an indication of living in the moment but also can be a sign that in your excitement you are behaving somewhat recklessly towards others. It can signify being irrational, lack of fun and lack of faith or hope.
