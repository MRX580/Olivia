The Lovers Tarot reversed indicates that you may be struggling to take ownership of the decisions you’ve made. This is causing conflict within you. You may be feeling uncertain of the direction your life is going in. You need to remember that you are the master of your own destiny. Don’t try to blame the universe if your situation is a result of choices that you’ve made. Instead be accountable, learn from past mistakes and let them go. If you do that you will be able to move forward in a position direction. You will develop a deeper understanding of your true self, your values and your beliefs and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.
