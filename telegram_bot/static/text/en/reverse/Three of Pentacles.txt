In a general context, the Three of Pentacles reversed is not a great card to get in a Tarot spread as it indicates that you are not learning from your mistakes or are unwilling to do so. You may be overwhelmed with the sense that you do not know what you are doing. However, you are not putting the effort into learning! This card signifies a poor work ethic and a lack of effort, determination or commitment. You may be lacking the concentration and dedication required to achieve your goals or you may not have even set yourself any goals. It can signify feeling apathy toward the various areas of your life and just not giving things your best efforts. Everything just seems lacklustre and there is no motivation or growth. This Minor Arcana card can also indicate delays caused by conflict within a team or a lack of team spirit.
