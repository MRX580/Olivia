In a general context, Temperance reversed indicates imbalance or overindulgence.  This Major Arcana card can be an indicator that you are behaving in a hasty or reckless fashion. It can be a signifier of many issues with excessive or harmful indulgences such as drinking, drug use, gambling, overeating, shopping and the list goes on. The Temperance Tarot card in a reversed position may be telling you that you have lost touch with your own inner calm and tranquillity which can lead you to seek gratification in risky, harmful ways. Temperance reversed can also indicate a lack of harmony with the people in your life so you may find yourself clashing with those closest to you or allowing yourself to be dragged into other people’s drama. You may be lacking perspective and not looking at the bigger picture. You would do well to take a step back and take a look at how you are behaving, examine the root causes and work on resolving them.
