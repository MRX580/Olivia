In a general context, the Three of Swords reversed represents overcoming unhappiness, heartache, sorrow and sadness. When reversed, it is a Minor Arcana card of optimism, overcoming grief or depression and releasing pain. When it appears in your Tarot reading it generally indicates that you are recovering from your heartbreak and getting over the worst part of a bad situation or event. You may be reaching out to friends and sharing your problems or reconciling with someone whom you were hurt by in the past. You may have reached a compromise or be at a point where you are able to forgive and let go of past trauma. Alternatively, the Three of Swords reversed has a flip side. It can be an indication that you are repressing your grief, sorrow or traumatic memories. That you are refusing to let go of negative emotions and are holding onto your pain. Look to support cards to confirm this.Â
