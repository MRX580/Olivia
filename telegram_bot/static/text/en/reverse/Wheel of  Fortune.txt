In a general context, the Wheel of Fortune reversed Tarot card still indicates change but this change is likely to be negative and unwelcome. The reversed Wheel of Fortune is a strong indicator that there is a challenging time ahead and that the change coming may be difficult to adjust to. It can represent that things had been going well and have suddenly and quite unexpectedly fallen apart. This sudden deterioration can leave you feeling powerless, out of control and as if external forces are working against you. However, that is not the case. While there may be some outside factors, the current situation is most likely a result of decisions you made. You will need to take control of your situation and ownership of your choices in order to learn from this situation. Although things may be tough with the Wheel of Fortune in reverse, there is a big opportunity for you to learn karmic lessons here that will help you move on to a brighter and better future, seize the opportunity and donâ€™t resist change. These ups and downs are part of life and often we learn more from hardship than we do from good fortune.
