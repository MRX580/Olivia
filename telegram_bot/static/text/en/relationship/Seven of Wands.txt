In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Seven of Wands tells you that you have some challenges coming up and if you want your relationship to go the distance you are going to have to fight for it. This challenge may come from inside the relationship in the form of you or your partner trying to blame each other for issues. This Minor Arcana card can also indicate that your relationship is under attack from third parties and that you need to protect and defend it. You will need to maintain control, hold your own and be determined. Don’t let others ruin what you have. If you are single, the Seven of Wands suggests that if you are interested in someone you are going to have to fight for them. There may be serious competition for this person’s affection and if you allow yourself to sink into the background, you may get overlooked.
