In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the Queen of Swords can indicate that you are in a relationship with someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. As a partner, she likes her own space and is extremely discerning about the people she dates or has relationships with. She will not be overly slushy and may not like public displays of affection but she can be very affectionate and loving and she is incredibly loyal, witty and kind. This Minor Arcana card can represent a woman who is in a relationship but misses some of the freedom and independence of being single. It can also indicate that a bluntly honest mature woman may have a lot to say about your relationship. This could be a mature female friend, mother or mother-in-law giving their opinion. Again, they will not mince their words but they may provide constructive criticism that you would do well to take on board. If you are single, the Queen of Swords can indicate that you will meet someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. This card can represent a person who has had some hard knocks in life but has come through them stronger and wiser. It can represent being divorced or a single mother so you may meet someone in those circumstances or be in them yourself as you enter the dating world. It can also indicate that you love single life, are fiercely protective of your independence and need a partner who can understand your need for freedom and compliment your life. This card indicates that you would like to meet someone who can enrich your life but you are self-sufficient enough not to need one. This is a great position to be in when dating as you can afford to be selective.
