In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship the Page of Swords can indicate that there may be some conflict in your relationship as you allow yourself to be drawn into unnecessary or petty arguments with your partner. By all means fight your corner over the important things, but don’t allow every tiny disagreement to spiral in to a full blown argument. If you are waiting on news or a development in your relationship, this card can tell you that it will be delayed or will take a bit longer than you think. Be patient!  If you are single, the Page of Swords may be telling you that you need to make more of an effort to socialise if you want to meet someone. If you have been hoping for a relationship, this card can tell you that it will take longer than you think and you need to be patient.
