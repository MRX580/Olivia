In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Nine of Wands indicates that you and your partner have been going through a rough time. Whether that’s in how you relate to each other or just in life in general, recent events have left you sapped of all energy. You may feel like giving up and calling it quits but this Minor Arcana card tells you to keep going! You are through the worst so you just need to gather your strength and push forward and you will get to where you want to be. This card can also indicate that you or your partner has been wounded and hurt in past relationships and this may be having a negative effect on your relationship. If you are single, the Nine of Wands indicates that you are still wounded from a string of relationships that didn’t work out how you wanted and these wounds are preventing you from finding the happy and healthy relationship you deserve. It may feel like you will never get past this, but you are so close! Don’t give up on yourself! Just make sure the next person you allow into your life is worthy of your love and guard your heart until they’ve earned your trust.
