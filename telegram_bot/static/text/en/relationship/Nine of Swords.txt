In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Nine of Swords indicates that your relationship is not a happy one at the moment. This Minor Arcana card signifies guilt, remorse and regret so it can be sign that keeping secrets, infidelity or deception is taking its toll on the relationship. Again, this card can be indicative of abuse or bullying and the mental and emotional anguish that goes with that. However, it can also simply signify that one of you is overwhelmed with stress or burdens or suffering from an anxiety disorder or hormonal issue that is making the relationship a challenge at the moment. If you are single, the Nine of Swords indicates that you may be dwelling on the past. Feelings of remorse, guilt or regret relating to past relationships may be overwhelming you and causing you deep unhappiness. You may be wishing you could go back in time and change the past. However, dwelling on it will not change it. You need to find a way to heal from the past and learn from it. Once you do that, you future will open up before you. This card can also indicate that you may find yourself being the subject of gossip.
