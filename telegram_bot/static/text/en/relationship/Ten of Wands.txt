In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Ten of Wands indicates that you are overloaded or overburdened by the relationship. You may feel as though your partner takes you for granted, you may be carrying the full weight of the relationship on your shoulders while your partner takes a back seat and you may feel saddled with all the stress and responsibility of the relationship. This Minor Arcana card indicates that the fun and spontaneity has gone out of the relationship and has been replaced by duty and obligation making every day an uphill struggle. If you are single, the Ten of Wands indicates that the fun has gone out of your love life. You may be stressed and overburdened to the point that you donâ€™t have time for dating or meeting someone new and excitement has been replaced by drudgery. If you want love in your life you have to make time for it!
