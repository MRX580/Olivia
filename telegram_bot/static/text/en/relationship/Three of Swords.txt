In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Three of Swords is not a great omen as it represents tears, heartache, heartbreak, sorrow and conflict. This does not have to mean the end of your relationship but it does strongly indicate that there are some difficult issues that need to be addressed in order for the relationship to survive. You need to sit down with your partner and have an open and honest discussion about how you feel and respectfully listen to each other. Descending into arguments, nasty comments or recriminations will only cause the situation to worsen. You may have become unhappy or disillusioned with the relationship or there may simply be a lack of communication between you and your partner leading to serious misunderstandings between the two of you and a sense of alienation or loneliness in the relationship. The Three of Swords can indicate a breakup, divorce or separation and the legal matters associated with such events. The three swords of this Minor Arcana card can also indicate the involvement of a third party. This may mean interference from a third party trying to stir trouble. In some cases, it can represent cheating or infidelity as it is a card of upheaval and betrayal. If you are single, the Three of Swords can indicate loneliness or alienation. You may be still feeling the loss of your previous relationship and struggling to come to terms with your grief. You will need to deal with your grief in order to move on. It can also indicate being the person with whom someone cheats on their partner. Ask yourself would someone who really loves and values you put you in this position?
