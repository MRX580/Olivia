Strength is the Major Arcana card that represents the Leo star sign so a relationship with a Leo may be on the cards if this appears. If you are single the Strength card is an indicator that now is a great time to meet someone as your confidence will be shining through. It can also be an indicator of a relationship coming up with someone who has a bit of a wild side. This can be an exciting prospect but if this person is too wild you may feel the need to tame them somewhat. If you do want to tame them, coax them gently, donâ€™t try to dominate them. For those already in a relationship, Strength is generally a good indicator that you are a strong couple, close and united. If your relationship has gone through a lot of emotional upheaval, this card suggest that you are starting to get back on top of it and that any problems you faced in the past have actually brought you closer together.
