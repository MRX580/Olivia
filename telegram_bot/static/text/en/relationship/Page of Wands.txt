In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Page of Wands can indicate that romantic messages or good news may be coming your way. This Minor Arcana card can also represent a new wave of passion and playfulness for your relationship, so be prepared for some exciting days and nights when it appears in your Tarot spread. It can also suggest that you and your partner may be setting off on a travel adventure together or starting some sort of new physical or outdoor activity that will bring fresh excitement to you. The Page of Wands can signify sparks flying in a relationship so you may find yourselves having sudden rows which just as suddenly turn in to passionate making-up sessions. If you have been feeling unhappy in the relationship, the Page of Wands may be telling you it is “make or break” time. You may have initially had an intense connection with your partner but now the initial excitement is wearing off and you are wondering if you are suited. If you do believe that the relationship is worth holding on to, don’t get clingy with your partner during this phase as it will kill the attraction between you. Instead make time for your own interests to give yourself and your partner a little bit of space to miss each other. When you do see your partner, try to take it back to basics, flirt with them and tease each other, it will reignite the spark. If you are single, the Page of Wands suggests that a new romance is coming your way. This whirlwind romance will be full of fun, flirting, sex, excitement and intensity. This person will worship you and you can expect plenty of passion from them. However, the relationship may be short-lived or this person may be a bit of a flirt. Ensure you are not jealous or needy if you want to keep them interested.
