In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Five of Swords is not a great omen as it can indicate arguments, hostility and serious conflict arising due to a lack of communication. It is also a Minor Arcana card of deception and self-sabotaging behaviour so infidelity and cheating can be signified by this card. It can also indicate divorce or separation as it can represent defeat and walking away. In its extreme negative, the Five of Swords can indicate bullying, intimidation, abuse, violence, assault, rape and murder. You should not be in fear of your partner and if you are, this tells you that something is seriously wrong. If your partner is abusive, you need to recognise the danger you are in and reach out for the support of family and friends or organisations that can help you to get the strength to walk away and take back your power. No one who truly loved you would treat you that way. If you are single, the Five of Swords indicates that you may be seeking out relationships with people who have a dark side and are potentially dangerous or deceptive. The extreme negative of this card signifies the types situations you would never wish to find yourself in so ensure you are taking proper precautions when going on dates with people you do not know very well such as meeting in a public place and letting a family member or friend know who you are meeting and where etc.
