In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship, Judgement can indicate that you or your partner may be judging each other too harshly. Be wary of throwing blame or accusations at each other during arguments to try and provoke a reaction, you may do more damage to your relationship than you mean to. Instead try to sit down and talk through how you are feeling without trying to apportion blame. You need to forgive past mistakes if you want the relationship to move forward. You may be able to breathe new life into a relationship that’s falling flat with simple, open and honest communication. It can also indicate that others are judging your relationship or talking about you and your partner behind your back. The best thing you can do in this instance is rise above it. It’s really their issue, not yours. Alternatively, Judgement can signify being separated from someone you love by an ocean or sea so it may indicate that you and your partner could be living in separate countries for a while or having a long distance relationship. If you are single, judgement tells you not to be too hasty in judging potential partners. Give yourself a chance to get to know them before you decide if they are right or wrong for you. It also reminds you to be mindful of how you come across as you never get a second chance to make a first impression!
