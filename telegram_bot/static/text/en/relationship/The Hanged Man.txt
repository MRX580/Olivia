In a love Tarot context if you are in a relationship, The Hanged Man indicates that you may be unhappy with the way your relationship is going at the moment. It can also signify that either you or your partner may be feeling the need to take a step back from the relationship to assess your options or where you want the relationship to lead. The Hanged Man tells you to hold off on making any decisions and just give yourself time to think things through. You may need to rethink your perceptions of what your relationship should be like and focus on the positive aspects of the relationship as it is instead of worrying about what it isn’t. Alternatively, if you find that you are truly unhappy, The Hanged Man appearing in your Tarot reading tells you that you are the only one keeping yourself in this situation. You can walk away if you want to. If you are single, The Hanged Man can indicate that you need to release yourself from situations, ideas or people that do not make you happy. This may involve releasing old negative relationship patterns. If you have been holding on to your feelings for an ex, The Hanged Man tells you it’s time to release those feelings. It may also signify that you need to release any rigid preconceptions about your ideal partner in order to open yourself up to the options around you.
