In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Three of Pentacles indicates that you are committed to the relationship and are putting the effort in to it to make things work. If you have been having issues in the relationship, it can be a sign that you may seek the help of a relationship counsellor to overcome your issues. You and your partner are growing together and learning about each other. If your relationship is relatively new, the Three of Pentacles can represent a time in the relationship where you are learning all about each other and figuring out how to share your lives with each other. If you are single, the Three of Pentacles can indicate that someone you like has noticed you too. It can also mean that you may meet a potential partner through work or study.
