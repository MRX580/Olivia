In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Six of Cups can simply indicate that you and your partner are childhood sweethearts. If the surrounding cards are positive, it can signify having children. However, it can also indicate problems or issues being caused in a relationship by immaturity or childishness. It can signify that your relationship is being held back because you are yearning for a past love or that a previous partner is influencing your relationship or causing arguments. If you are single, the Six of Cups can signify a past lover coming back into your life, becoming romantically involved with a childhood friend or finding love in the area where you grew up.
