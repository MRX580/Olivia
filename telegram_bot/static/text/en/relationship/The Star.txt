The Star in a love Tarot reading can indicate a relationship with an Aquarius. If you are single, The Star is an indicator that you are ready to let go of any baggage you have been carrying from past relationships. Your future love life looks positive and now is a great time to meet people. It can also signify someone from your past coming back into your life to rekindle a relationship. If you are in a relationship the Star is a sign that your relationship will be progressing into something deeper. If you have had problems in the relationship previously, The Star tells you that these issues can be healed and you can have a bright future if you open yourself up to healing.
