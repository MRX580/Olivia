In a Love Tarot reading, The Chariot suggests that you need to conquer your emotions in order to have a successful relationship. If you and your partner have been going through a rough patch, you will need to come together, communicate and work hard. The challenges you face are not insurmountable. They just require some hard work and focus to resolve them. If you or your partner anxiety issues, it is crucial to get these under control as The Chariot Tarot also represents the need to balance the mind and heart to be successful. If your partner uses logic as emotional armour, you may need to get around their defences in order for your relationship to work. If you are single, The Chariot is an indication that your past relationships have let you battle weary. The Chariot signifies that you can overcome the pain of your past and move forward in your love life.
