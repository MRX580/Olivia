In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Four of Swords can indicate that you and your partner are taking time out to rest, regroup and reconnect in your relationship. Fear, anxiety and stress have left you and your partner feeling in need of some peace and quiet. One of both of you may have disconnected from the relationship or is seeking solitude as a reaction to the overwhelming pressure you are feeling at the moment. Some quality time away from the stress is needed to help you both to reconnect, remember why you are together and plan how you are going to deal with stress in the future. If you are single, the Four of Swords can signify that you need some introspection and solitude in order to contemplate what you really want in a partner. Do not allow fear about being single overwhelm you. If you jump into a relationship solely out of fear of being single, it will not work out well for you! The right person will often come into our lives when we’re not looking for them.
