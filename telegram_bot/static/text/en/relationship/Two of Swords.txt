In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Two of Swords can indicate a stalemate or a relationship at a crossroads. It may be that you and your partner have been arguing frequently lately or cannot agree on an important relationship decision and have called a temporary truce. You may simply need a bit of time and space to consider the pros and cons of the matter and how you can come to an agreement. You may simply be reluctant to make a decision on this matter as you risk being vulnerable. However, it can also indicate that a painful choice needs to be made regarding the future of the relationship but you are both sitting on the fence because of the pain the decision will bring. This Minor Arcana card can also signify being torn between two relationships. Whatever the case, you need to face your fears and make a decision so that everyone concerned can move forward in their lives either together or separately. If you are single, the Two of Swords can indicate you have a choice between two potential partners and this choice may be causing you great difficulty. However, the choice does need to be made for the good of all concerned as it is unfair to keep stringing them along. Alternatively, it can mean that you are avoiding letting someone know you are interested for fear of rejection.
