In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the King of Wands can indicate that you are in a relationship with someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. If this is your partner, bear in mind that nothing will turn him off you quicker than you being clingy or needy. He is attracted to women who are independent and strong and do not try to restrict his freedom. If the King of Wands feels emotionally overwhelmed, he will emotionally cut-off quite suddenly and run for the hills. However, this card can simply be an indication that your partner has warm feelings for you and is protective of you. If you are single, the King of Wands can indicate that you will meet someone who embodies the qualities outlined in the above section or you are displaying some of those characteristics yourself in your love life. If this represents someone you are interested in, remember to allow this person their freedom if you want to have a long lasting relationship with them. This Minor Arcana card can also indicate that you are so busy with the other areas of your life or enjoying the freedom of single life that you are not making time to find a partner. If you are looking for love, you need to make some space for someone to come into your life.
