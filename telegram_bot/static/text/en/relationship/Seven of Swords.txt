In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Seven of Swords is not a great omen as it can indicate deception, betrayal, lies and cheating. This may be a sign of infidelity in the relationship. However, don’t jump to conclusions when it appears as it can indicate many types of deception not just cheating. Perhaps one of you is not being honest about your feelings or may be trying to manipulate the other rather than being honest and upfront about what you want. This Minor Arcana card also represents enemies masquerading as friends so it can also signify a third party trying to stir trouble in your relationship! If you are single, the Seven of Swords indicates that you may meet someone who is deceitful and manipulative so be careful. At the same time, it tells you that if you want a genuine, loving relationship you need to resist the urge to play games with your potential partners and steer clear of people who play games with you. You may be relying on your sharp wit and cunning to stay ahead of the game when it comes to dating or you may be over-rationalising your attitude to romance. Game playing may keep your partner interested at the beginning but at some stage, when you’ve built up some trust in them, you really just have to drop the act, be yourself and allow yourself to be vulnerable with another person!
