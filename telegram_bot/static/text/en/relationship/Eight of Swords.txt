In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Eight of Swords is not a great omen as it can represent feeling trapped, confined or backed into a corner in your relationship. You may be feeling like you cannot escape but that is only your perception! It may not be easy but you can find a way to leave if you want to.  This Minor Arcana card can also signify a relationship in crisis, drama, dilemmas and negativity so your relationship may not be in a great place at the moment. In the extreme negative, it can indicate an abusive relationship as it represents being victimised and feeling powerless and hopeless. Remember, there are organisations that can help if you are in that situation. It can also represent judgement and consequences so if there has been any cheating in the relationship, this card sees the betrayal coming to light. If you are single, the Eight of Swords indicates that you may be waiting for someone to swoop in and right everything that you feel has gone wrong in your life. Remember that true happiness comes from within. It is not a partner’s job to fix your life and if that’s what you are waiting for you are likely to either put potential partners off as they sense your desperation or to attract the wrong type of relationship. You need to work on finding inner contentment for yourself. When you find that, you will be ready to welcome the right kind of partner into your life.
