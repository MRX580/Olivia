In a love Tarot spread, if you are single, the Ace of Pentacles indicates that you have a fresh start coming in terms of love. You should be meeting someone new soon, potentially through work or business. A relationship with this person will provide you with a sense of security and stability and they will be a positive grounding influence in your life. If you are in relationship, the Ace of Pentacles is a good card to get as it represents abundance and stability. You should be feeling very blessed and secure in your relationship when it appears. This sense of security will allow both of you to be independent and flourish in your lives while safe in the knowledge that you have the support of a solid relationship. It also can indicate a sense of excitement about next steps in the relationship.
