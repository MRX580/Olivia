In a love Tarot spread, if you are single, the Seven of Cups indicates that you will have lots of potential partners interested in you and lots of opportunities for romance. If you are in a relationship, the Seven of Cups can indicate that a new potential love interest may appear and cause issues in your current relationship or cause you to question the relationship. Alternately, it can be a sign that you are putting too much energy into fantasising about what you wish your relationship was like instead of dealing with the reality of the relationship. If can also indicate that you may be feeling discontented with the fact that the initial “butterflies in the stomach” phase of the relationship has passed. Just because the initial excitement may have worn off, doesn’t mean you can’t have a passionate, fun relationship if you put the effort in. Remember, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side.
