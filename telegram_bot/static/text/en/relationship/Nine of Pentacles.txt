In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Nine of Pentacles can indicate stability and security in a relationship that gives you the freedom, independence and support to pursue your dreams. If you are in business or building your career, your partner will offer you support and encouragement.  You and your partner are likely to have similar goals and will work hard to achieve them. For mature couples, it can be an indication that you have reached a point in your relationship where you can finally stop and smell the roses and enjoy the rewards of all the hard work you have put in over the years. If you are single, it can indicate enjoying the freedom and independence of being single. It can also indicate a relationship with an independent women or a mature woman who is beautiful, stylish, sophisticated, elegant or graceful. Or, it can signify that you will display those characteristics yourself. Whatever the case, anyone who wants to start a relationship with the lady represented by this Minor Arcana card will have to work hard to earn her respect or affection, she has worked hard to get to where she is and won’t allow anyone in to her life who is not worthy of being there. It can also indicate pregnancy or birth, look to supporting cards to confirm this.
