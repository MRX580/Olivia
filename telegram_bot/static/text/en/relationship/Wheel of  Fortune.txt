If you are in a relationship, Wheel of Fortune in an upright position normally indicates a positive change so you could be taking the next step in your relationship or starting a new phase with your partner or even some sort of joint project. At the same time, the change the Wheel of Fortune Tarot card brings can be difficult. If you have been finding that you are no longer content in a relationship, this card can signal an upheaval. That could be you and your partner shaking things up and making much needed changes to improve your relationship or it could be a breakup that will leave you free to move onto better things. Whatever happens, it will lead you to where you are supposed to be. If you are single, Wheel of Fortune in your Tarot reading can indicate that the universe is working to bring you the love you deserve but you have to work with the universe! You have good fortune coming in love so now is the time to put yourself out there, get out and meet new people. Make sure you are discerning about exactly what you want in a partner as you have an opportunity to get just that with this card making an appearance in your Tarot spread. The Wheel of Fortune is also a card of destiny so in a love context it can signify soulmates. If you are single you may be meeting yours soon. If you are in a relationship, it may indicate that you and your partner are meant to be! Look to the supporting cards to confirm this.Â
