In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Ten of Swords is not a great omen as it indicates breakups, divorce, separation, bitterness or severing ties. If this card relates to a breakup, you will probably already be aware that the relationship is in serious trouble. This Minor Arcana card is telling you that you need to accept it. This card can also indicate betrayal and infidelity. Alternatively, this card may simply indicate that you are being overly dramatic, attention seeking or playing the victim with your partner. If this is the case, it could be the final nail in the relationship’s coffin if you do not stop that behaviour. If you are in an abusive relationship, the Ten of Swords warns you that you are in serious danger. You need to take immediate action to ensure your survival and safety. If you are single, the Ten of Swords can be an indication that you are still reeling from your last breakup. Even though you know the relationship was unhealthy and had run its course, you were not ready for it to end on some level and are still struggling to come to terms with the finality of the breakup. You need to take some time out to heal and to rediscover who you are and what actually makes you happy independently of a relationship.
