In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Five of Wands can represent rows, arguments, conflict and fighting. You and your partner may not see eye-to eye when it appears. This Minor Arcana card indicates that frustration, irritation and pent up aggression or competitiveness may be leading to disagreements in the relationship. Some couples thrive on a fiery relationship and rows and struggles keep them interested. If this is your type relationship then it may not be a bad omen. However, if you prefer a harmonious relationship then this card would indicate that you need to get your tempers under control, listen to each other, cooperate and compromise. Pettiness, egotistical behaviour and getting one up on each other will not help your relationship to progress. If you are single, the Five of Wands can indicate that you love life is a bit chaotic at the moment. This card would usually indicate that various suitors will be competing for your attention! Enjoy the attention but donâ€™t string it out too much or it could turn nasty.
