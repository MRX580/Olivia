In a career Tarot reading, the Six of Swords signifies that things on the work front are calming down. You may be moving into an easier phase in your work life where things are under control, you are accomplishing your goals and completing tasks with ease or you may have moved to a job that is much better for you. This card can also indicate travelling overseas for business purposes or moving premises. In a financial Tarot spread, if you have been struggling financially the Six of Swords can signify overcoming hardship and a relief from financial problems. You should be moving into a calmer time financially but it does come with a warning. You cannot run away from financial issues, if you want lasting peace of mind you must deal with your money issues and not run away from them.  If you finances have been going well this card indicates that they should progress nicely. However, don’t be overly cocky and start wasting money. Look at the placement and the supporting cards to ascertain whether the storm is ahead of you or behind you in terms of money.
