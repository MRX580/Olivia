In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Queen of Pentacles indicates that you will be feeling confident and secure in your relationship and deservedly so as you have worked hard to get to this point. You and your partner should be enjoying the finer things in life and may be indulging in a bit of luxury such as a weekend away at a fancy hotel. If representing a person in the relationship, this person will be kind, confident, generous, practical, loyal, nurturing and welcoming. The Queen of Pentacles is a wonderful mother, a charming hostess and a good homemaker. She is the type of woman other women look up to. If you are single, the Queen of Pentacles indicates that you can afford to be very selective when choosing a partner. You have put a lot of effort into reaching this level of success in your life and you deserve a solid, stable relationship. You should be feeling very confident and capable when it appears. Any partner you choose needs to be on the same level and able to enrich your life. Alternatively, it can indicate that you will meet a woman who embodies the qualities of the Queen of Pentacles.
