In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, The Tower can be a bad omen representing, break-ups, separation or divorce. It can also represent either you or your partner or both, going through a difficult or traumatic event that will push your relationship to its absolute limits. If you want your relationship to survive this Tower event, you will need to try to be there for each other and maintain open and honest communication. If your relationship survives this upheaval, The Tower tells you that the relationship will have changed significantly. This may not necessarily be a bad thing as The Tower represents destruction of false beliefs too, so the relationship may come out completely changed but with a more solid and honest foundation. However, getting to that point will be one of the most difficult things you will go through as a couple. If you are single, you may find that you suddenly have to face an uncomfortable revelation about why you are single. If ego or arrogance has been getting in the way of you forming healthy relationships, it may indicate that a chaotic or destructive event is going to break down that ego. While this will not be a pleasant experience, it will teach you humility and improve your chances of a happy, healthy relationship in the future.  The Tower can also indicate violence or assault so it can be a warning to be mindful of your personal safety when getting out there and meeting new people. Don’t be overly cautious but have your wits about you and take appropriate safety precautions.
