In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Ten of Pentacles is an indication of long-term security and stability. Your relationship will be based on a solid foundation when this card appears in your Tarot reading. It is also the Minor Arcana card of domestic harmony or bliss and can signify a conventional or traditional approach to family values. If you have been hoping for a deeper commitment, this card can indicate that it is on the way as it usually signifies moving in together, settling down, engagement, pre-nuptial agreements and marriage. It can also represent marrying into a wealthy family. The Ten of Pentacles bodes well for you and your family’s future and can signify that provisions are being put in place to secure it, such as buying a house, setting up a pension or making a will. If have been going through a rough patch, it can indicate that you or your partner’s issues may be inherited or conflict may be arising from a difference in backgrounds or family traditions. These issues can be resolved if you recognise the root cause of the conflict or if you are willing to compromise and find a way to merge your traditions and create new ones that are unique to you. If you are single, the Ten of Pentacles can indicate that a new love will come into your life. This may be someone who shares you values and could potentially be someone you will want to settle down with or have a long-term relationship with.
