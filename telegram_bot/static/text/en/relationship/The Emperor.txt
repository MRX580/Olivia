If you are single and interested in men, The Emperor in a love Tarot context can indicate a romantic relationship with an older man. He will like structure, order, logic and routine. He will be a good influence on you but romance is not his strong point. He is however practical, dependable and protective. If you are single and interested in women, The Emperor Tarot is a sign that you need to be more open with your feelings. If you have feelings for someone in particular you need to bite the bullet and tell her. Don’t expect her to guess! For those already in relationships, The Emperor is a good omen of monogamy and a long lasting relationship. If you have been experiencing relationship problems they begin to improve and stability will return to the relationship.
