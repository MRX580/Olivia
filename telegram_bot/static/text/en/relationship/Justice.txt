In a love Tarot reading, if you are single, Justice can indicate a relationship with a person in the legal industry (judge, lawyer, legal secretary etc.) It is the Tarot card that corresponds to Libra, so a Libra may be coming into your life. If you have treated others with integrity and kindness and not been treated well in return in relationships, Justice in a love tarot reading can indicate that this imbalance is about to be corrected with the loving partner you deserve coming into your life. It can also signify that those who have treated you badly will get their comeuppance. If you are in a relationship, whether Justice is a good or bad omen really depends on the behaviour of you and your partner. If you are both being honest and acting with integrity in your relationship then you will see the rewards in the form of a period of harmony or a bigger commitment. It can indicate marriage, representing the marriage contract. However, if either of you have been dishonest or have cheated, Justice indicates that the truth will be revealed and whoever has been dishonest will reap what they have sown.
