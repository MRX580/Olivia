In a love Tarot reading, the Four of Pentacles is not a great card to get. If you are in a relationship, it can indicate that either you or your partner may be acting in a possessive, jealous or controlling manner which could be having a negative effect on your relationship. Be careful not to hold on so tight that you squeeze the life out of your relationship. It can also be an indication that one of you is holding onto past wrongs or a grudge or that there are deep seated issues causing issues in the relationship. If you partner has wronged you in some way you will need to make a decision to either forgive them and move forward together or let go of the relationship. Holding onto grudges is toxic and breeds resentment. If you are single, the Four of Pentacles indicates that you may be holding yourself back from meeting someone new. This may be because you fear change, you are not approaching new relationships with an open mind and heart or it can be an indication that you are still holding onto feelings for an ex and are not ready to move on. Whatever the cause you will need to resolve these issues before you can fully embrace a new relationship.
