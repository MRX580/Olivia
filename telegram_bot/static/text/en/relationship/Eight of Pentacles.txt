In a love Tarot reading, if you are in a relationship, the Eight of Pentacles indicates that you are putting a lot of work, dedication and commitment in to your relationship. The effort youâ€™re putting in should be paying off and the relationship moving along nicely. This Minor Arcana card indicates that you and your partner should be well on your way to achieving your mutual goals. It can also signify working hard to secure your future financially for you and your partner or family. Be sure to balance this workload with family life and spending time with your partner. If you are single, you should be feeling confident when the Eight of Pentacles appears. However, this card can indicate that a period of apprenticeship is required before you can move forward as you need to learn from your past relationships and deal with their effects in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.
