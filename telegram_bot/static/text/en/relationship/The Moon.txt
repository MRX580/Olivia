If you are in a relationship, The Moon Tarot card in a love Tarot reading can indicate that you may be feeling uncertain or insecure in the relationship. If your relationship looks fine to the outside world, The Moon can show that things are not as perfect as they seem. There may be miscommunication in the relationship. There could be a lot of arguments or old issues or insecurities coming to the surface. It can also signify deception, but don’t jump to conclusions if you see it in your Tarot reading. Stay calm and wait until the facts of the matter become clearer. If you are single, The Moon can indicate deceit around you or that you may be being conned. If you are dating, be mindful that this person’s intentions may not be as honourable as they seem or you may not have all the facts about them yet. It indicates that there is some piece of information that is yet to reveal itself.
