If you are single, the Page of Pentacles tells you that are plenty of opportunities for love you just have to grab them with both hands. If you are interested in a particular person, this Minor Arcana card tells you not to sit on the fence about. If you want them you need to jump in with both feet and take your chances. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!
