In a love Tarot reading, the Five of Pentacles is not a good omen to get. If you are in a relationship, it can indicate that you may be struggling with feeling abandoned, ignored or unloved within the relationship. You may be rejected or left out in the cold by your partner and in its extreme negative it can signify breakups, separations or divorce. It can also represent scandal, illegitimate children or being in a relationship that is considered improper or disgraceful by those around you. However, it can simply indicate that you and your partner could be struggling with financial issues or health problems and this may be causing a strain on your relationship. If you love each other you will have to make a decision to pull together instead of apart.  If you are single, the Five of Pentacles can be an indication that you are feeling rejected or have been given the cold shoulder by someone you’re interested in. You may be feeling lonely, isolated or like an outcast. It can also simply represent being a single parent and the struggles that can bring.
