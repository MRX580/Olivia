In a love Tarot spread, if you are in a relationship the Two of Wands is not a great omen as it can indicate that there is a lack of contentment in the relationship. You or your partner may be feeling restless, withdrawn or detached when it appears in your relationship Tarot spread. This Minor Arcana card can also be an indication of cheating as it can represent having a choice between a partner and a lover. However, this card is also a travel card so it may indicate that you and your partner may consider going travelling or emigrating when it appears in your Tarot reading. If you are single, the Two of Wands also indicates that you will have a choice between two lovers. This card also represents being torn between security and adventure so you may find one of these potential partners is steady and reliable and the other is daring and adventurous.
